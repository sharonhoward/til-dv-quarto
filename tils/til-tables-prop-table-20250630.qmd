## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  proportion of what? looks like topic, ie the first var that goes in table. check when using it 
-  but also! can use cor() to make a correlation matrix (-1 to +1) which might be better? 




## Example

```{r}
proportions(table(topic=cheshire_petitions$topic, type=cheshire_petitions$petition_type)) 

```



```{r}
#| include: false
