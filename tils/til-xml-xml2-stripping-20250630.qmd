## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```


The xml2::read_xml default is to strip out blank text nodes. There doesn't seem to be a named arg in options to tell it not to do that; as far as I can see, you have to use *options=""*. Srsly.


## Example

```{r}
# xml2::read_xml("filename.xml", options = "") 

```



```{r}
#| include: false
# atb/atb_writing/atb-making-text.Rmd:201:  
 

```
