## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  it's not exactly missing data, but sometimes you want something like this for ggplot 
-  fill=list(n=0) will fill missings with 0 instead of NA 




## Example

```{r}
judges100_appts |> 
  count(judge_id, court_type) |> 
  complete(judge_id, court_type, fill=list(n=0)) 

```
