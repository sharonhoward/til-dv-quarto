## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))

## Notes

-  this is a silly example but I can't think of a better way to do one right now! 
-  maybe get s&b data? 
 




## Example

```{r}
judges100_appts_counted <- 
judges100_appts |> 
  count(court_name)  
 
judges100_appts_counted |> 
  uncount(n) 

```
