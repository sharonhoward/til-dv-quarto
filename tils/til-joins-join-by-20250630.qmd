## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  with by= you have to quote the y though (til!) don't need to quote the x. 
-  eg 
-  judges100 |> 
-    inner_join(judges100_appts, by=(judge_id="judge_id")) 
-  but with join_by you don't need to quote at all. not sure if it works with different named cols 




## Example

```{r}
judges100 |> 
  select(judge_id, name_first, name_last, birth_date) |> 
  inner_join(judges100_appts, join_by(judge_id)) |> 
  arrange(judge_id) 
 

```
