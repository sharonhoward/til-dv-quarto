## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  useNA="no" "ifany" or "always" 
-  also learned about with/table   
-  using with() you get the dimname names by default, but you can choose to name them with (name)= 




## Example

```{r}
with(cheshire_petitions, 
     table(type=petition_type, gender=petition_gender, useNA = "ifany")) 

```



```{r}
#| include: false
# small_bills/sb_explore/themes/sb_counties.Rmd:479:  
# obo/obapi/api-play.qmd:254:  
# (latter on dimnames) 

```
