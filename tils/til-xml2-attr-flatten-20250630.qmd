## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  example needs a folder containing at least two TEI xml files. 




## Example

```{r}
library(xml2) 
 
tei_list <- list.files(here::here("data/xml/prep_for_txt"), full.names = TRUE) 
 
# don't need options="" in this case because you're only getting attributes. 
test_xml <-  map(tei_list, read_xml) 
 
# nb this is simple because the root node TEI has xml:id you want. might not always be that easy! 
test_xml |> 
   map(~xml_attr(., "id")) |> 
   unlist() 
 

```
