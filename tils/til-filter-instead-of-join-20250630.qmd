## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  you could potentially have multiple conditions in the filter, which you can't easily do with joins 




## Example

```{r}
cheshire_select <- 
  cheshire_petitions[3,] 
 
cheshire_petitions |> 
  filter(topic %in% cheshire_select$topic) 

```



```{r}
#| include: false
# beyond_notability/bn_wikibase/themes/bn_instance_of_2024.Rmd:718:   
# beyond_notability/bn_wikibase/themes/bn_instance_of.Rmd:1597:   

```
