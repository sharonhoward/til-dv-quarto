## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  xtabs is handy anyway because you have a data= option, and it does names 
-  use of ~ and + 
-  can also be used for uncounted data 




## Example

```{r}
cheshire_petitions_topic_type_counted <- 
cheshire_petitions |> 
  count(topic, petition_type) 
 
# with counted data 
xtabs(n~topic+petition_type, data=cheshire_petitions_topic_type_counted) 
 
# cf. with uncounted data. 
# xtabs(~topic+petition_type, data=cheshire_petitions) 
 

```
