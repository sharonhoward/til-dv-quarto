## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  example needs a folder with 2+ CSV files in it, with the same structure 




## Example

```{r}
# get list of files 
div_csvs_files <- 
  list.files(here::here("data/csv/"), pattern = "*.csv", full.names = T) 
 
# use map() to read_csv a folder of CSV files (makes a list) 
divs_list <- 
  map(div_csvs_files, read_csv)  
 
# nb this can be a bit slow. check if there are more efficient methods? 
bind_rows(divs_list) 
 

```



```{r}
#| include: false
# atb/atb_writing/atb-books-divs-outlines-notes.Rmd:143:  

# this uses local data
```
