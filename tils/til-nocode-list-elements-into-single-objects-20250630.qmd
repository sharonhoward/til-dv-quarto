## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  be wary of using this - not regarded as good practice? 
-  if you rerun the chunk, I think it just replaces them with the new versions cf. attach.  
-  and you need to be sure the names aren't already being used! 




## Example

```{r}
# list2env(named_list_of_dfs, envir = .GlobalEnv) 
 

```
