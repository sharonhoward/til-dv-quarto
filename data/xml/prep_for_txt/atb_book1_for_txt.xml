        <l>I'll dedicate my soul unto my God:</l>
        <l>My childhood, nonage, youth is by his rod</l>
        <l>To be directed; his staff to uphold</l>
        <l>My age and riper years 'til it has told </l>
        <l>The gracious goodness of our blessed God.</l>
        <l>What he has done for me, who by his word</l>
        <l>Raised my drooping spirits often times,</l>
        <l>Pardoned my sins, delivering me from crimes,</l>
        <l>And by his bloodshed purchased heaven,</l>
        <l>For humblest souls his grace has given.</l>
        <l>The gift is free, nor can we merit</l>
        <l>Aught of ourselves for to inherit,</l>
        <l>But what by the fall is made our own,</l>
        <l>The <quote xml:id="q-002" type="phrase" source="#_Romans_6:26">wages of sin's</quote> damnation.</l>
        <l>Then oh, my soul, do not decline</l>
        <l>This heavenly pilgrimage divine.</l>
        <l>Rise up, my heart, to heaven above</l>
        <l>And let thy Lord now prove thy love.</l>
        <l>Spring up amain and let his Holy Spirit</l>
        <l>Give thee <quote xml:id="q-003" type="phrase" source="#_1Peter_5:4">a crown of glory </quote>to inherit.</l>

        <l>Then fly aloft on wings of faith,</l>
        <l>And do what thy redeemer saith.</l>
        <l>Oh, follow him, stay not behind;</l>
        <l>For to be drove by every wind</l>
        <l>Of trifling, foolish, childish toys</l>
        <l>To interrupt thy solid lasting joys,</l>
        <l>Which are ever living, never ending:</l>
        <l>There are pleasures worth commending.</l>
        <l>Come on, my soul, hoist up thy highest sails</l>
        <l>And creep not still on like weary snails.</l>
        <l>Pour out thy soul by prayer to God on high,</l>
        <l>Lay thou fast hold on him until thou die.</l>
        <l>Then guide me, Lord, give my soul directions,</l>
        <l>Subdue my passions, curb my stout affections,</l>
        <l>Nip thou the bud, before the bloom begins:</l>
        <l>Lord, ever keep me from presumptuous sins.</l>
        <l>And make me ever choose what you seest best,</l>

            After this, it pleased God to come into my soul,
                 by some beams of his mercy, in putting good thoughts into my mind to consider his great and miraculous
                 power in the creation of the heavens, the earth and all
                 the hosts of them. I was moved to this meditation
                 upon the reading of the daily psalms for the months:
                happening that day to be <ref source="#GB_Psalms_147:4">Psalm 14:4:</ref>

                  From whence there came into my heart
                 a forcible consideration of the incomprehensible
                 power and infinite majesty of Almighty God, <quote xml:id="q-019" type="allusion" source="#GB_Psalms_136:5 #KJV_Psalms_136:5 #GB_Jeremiah_10:12 #KJV_Jeremiah_10:12 #GB_Jeremiah_51:15 #KJV_Jeremiah_51:15">who

                 me into a deep fear and great awe of his <quote xml:id="q-022" type="phrase" source="#KJV_Psalms_145:12 #GB_Psalms_145:5">glorious

                 sins: were they never so many as the stars, yet

                 20 years almost to his utter ruin. His adversary
                 being so potent that he could not get his cause heard
                 until that time, when — through the uprightness of the

                This providence was the more remarkable that God

                 found all manner of relief for us all, which we wanted.

                cleared upon the scaffold in his speech made then.

                 not be subject to our church government and orders, but affected a loose libertinism to their
                 own pernicious ways) joined with the Irish in

            <p>But, to return to <rs ref="ppl:tw1" type="person">my Lord Lieutenant</rs>: while the

                of England then sitting in the year <date when-custom="1640">1640</date>, and false
                 suggestions of oppressions against <rs ref="ppl:tw1" type="person">this noble

                to such articles as his enemies of all factions
                 had unjustly laid to his charge.</p>
            <p>The whole transaction of this business was prosecuted with so much malice and rigour of his enemies'
                 side, and so much wisdom, prudence and gallantry
                 on the earl's that all the world (save his enemies thirsting
                 his blood) did admire his incomparable wisdom and
                 abilities in his clear and brave defence he made for 
                 himself (notwithstanding they gave fresh charges each
                 day which he had never heard of, nor had he any time
                 spared to give in his answer, but was set upon with
                new bloodhounds as their fancies pleased).</p>

            <p>Neither was he allowed the benefit of his witnesses
                 only. There was that in his trial done which was never
                 heard of before: for want of full evidence against
                 him (which was screwed to the height too) an invention 
                forged of accumulative treason and a particular
                act made in that parliament to confirm the same
                 until they had got his life.</p>
            <p>And then another following act, after his death, to abrogate and disannul the other forever that it might
                 never be in force against any other person.
                 The world may by this judge the truth and legality
                 of these proceedings against this brave person.
                 But the truth is, he had so much of wrong and 
                 injustice done in all the prosecution, as no man
                but of infinite abilities (which God had wonderfully
                 given him) could have withstood those mastiffs
                 and bloodhounds in the quick retorts and vindication
                 of his innocent actions, returning their malice
                 on their own false suggestions.</p>
            <p>So that, lest these articles and other artifices in
                the house should not prevail with <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs> (who did
                 clear him in his own judgement) there was the

            vulgar, meaner people, such as had ignorance

                to subvert the laws and bring in popery — gathered
                together in infinite numbers of prentices of London
                and headstrong separates and schismatics.</p>
           
            <p>The great numbers meeting at the parliament house,
                daily clamoured and cried out against <rs ref="ppl:tw1" type="person">my lord</rs> and
                <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs>, did so increase that the tumults had nigh to

                 removed from <placeName ref="place:Whit_084">Whitehall</placeName> to the parliament, still

            <p> So that, to satisfy their cruel malice and to give

                 would do but <rs ref="ppl:tw1" type="person">this innocent earl's</rs> life to be
                 taken from him.</p>
            <p>This <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the most pious king</rs> could very hardly be
                 drawn to, being pressed to sign the bill (he still
                declaring his innocency, in his conscience, he was not
                worthy of death). But <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs>, being constrained
                 for the safeguard of his own life, passed that fatal
                bill, with two others that day, which proved as destructive
                to him and the church and kingdom, as this of <persName ref="ppl:tw1">Strafford's</persName>:
 that of excluding the bishops out of the house of
                parliament and the other of triennial parliaments,

                and the better capacitated to fight against <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">their
                 lawful sovereign</rs>; albeit they pulled upon themselves and the kingdom a fatal ruin within a few
                 years after, but principally against <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">our
                 sacred majesty</rs> which was the mark with the crown
                 which they aimed at.</p>
            <p>But <rs ref="ppl:tw1" type="person">this gallant earl</rs>, so much desiring the
                peace and happiness of <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">his majesty</rs> and kingdoms,
                did acquit <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs> constrained and cheerfully
                 submitted to that sentence with so much serenity and
                 tranquillity of thoughts as is imaginable. Only
                 did justify his innocency to the death as maybe
                seen in his papers and last speech. He forgave his
                adversaries and wished, as he was the first that had
                 laid down his life in this way for the preservation
                of the king and church, so that he might be the last innocent bloodshed. But he much feared it.</p>
            <p>He put up prayers for <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs> and the whole kingdom
                 as it may be seen in his trial, written by an eye and
                 ear witness. And upon the <date when-custom="1641-05-12">12th of May 1641</date>,

          <persName ref="ppl:jb4">The Bishop of Derry</persName> being called on <date when-custom="1640-12-03">Thursday</date> at
                 night, who told him he perceived he grew weaker
                 in body that he would do well to declare in
              public his faith and hope in God, not that he questioned the same (he, being fully satisfied)
                 but that it was usual in those cases for the comfort
                 and instruction of the company.</p>
            <p>Immediately, <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs> raised up
                himself with all his force, and steadfastly fixed his eyes to heaven, then made (before many
                persons of quality, with <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>) a most
                 heavenly and pathetically confession of his faith,
                 hope and confidence in God. And that his heart did
                 fully rely upon the all-saving merits of Jesus
                 Christ, his redeemer; in him alone, hoped for pardon
                and remission of all his sins and for salvation through
                his blood, which was shed for him,</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-035"/>



            
          <p>and that, in him, he hoped for eternal glory of his
                 own free grace and mercy. He desired the Lord to forgive all his sins as he freely forgave all the 
              world and declaring that he died in the faith
                 which was professed in the Church of England at that time,
              being most pure and holy and agreeing with Christ's
                 institution, praying to God long to continue it
                 flourishing.</p>
          <p>Many other prayers for himself and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">his wife</rs> and
                 <rs type="group">children</rs>, desiring to be accepted of the Lord in
                 mercy, according to the sincerity of his heart.
              After devout prayers for him by <rs ref="ppl:jb4" type="person">the bishop</rs> and the solemn
                 pronunciation of absolution in order to the church's
                 command, <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">this dear and sweet saint</rs> freely
                 yielded up his precious soul to God, with these

                 Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Amen'.</p>
          
          <p>With which he fell asleep, which blessed end of his life,
              being a happy close of his holy life, has (I hope) received
                 a full reward of joy in the kingdom of heaven and
                 struck a most deep impression upon all that knew
                 him. I pray the Lord continue his memory fresh in

                 God saith more: <quote xml:id="q-088" type="partial" source="#_Isaiah_57:1">the merciful men are taken away
                 too</quote>, as if this gift of mercy were of more use to them

            <pb xml:id="page-042"/>



            
                 
            
            what remains amongst men when an unmerciful
                 man is ruler over them, but expectations to be devoured
                  and torn asunder through avarice, pride, factions,
                self-interest and what not? Even all confusion in 
                 such a kingdom, place or family.</p>
            <p>And, without an infinite mercy to prevent, will proceed to utter destruction; yet, the fears of this will not
                 rouse this secure people out of the lethargy of sin.
                 <quote xml:id="q-090" type="paraphrase" source="#_Isaiah_57:1">When these righteous perish,</quote> yet will they not consider when it is done to warn them of their own ruin that
                 merciful men go; nor will awaken to look about
                     and inquire, by the word,  of the cause of God's dealing
                <quote xml:id="q-091" type="paraphrase" source="#_Isaiah_57:1">to take them away (that it is from the evil to come</quote>
                 and so, by that means, be converted that he should
                 heal them). </p> 
            <p>As it was with the stubborn Jews, so it is our own
                 case, God knows, in these kingdoms. Our sins
                 were ripe for to be cut down by the <quote xml:id="q-092" type="allusion" source="#_Revelation_14:14">sickle of God's
                     judgements</quote> by our enemies, and for them to fall on <rs type="place">this kingdom</rs>
                 whose bloody desires had so far besotted their hearts that
                 were upon a speedy execution of their designs.
                All whose secret intentions God saw and, that <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
                 father's</rs> soul was grieved for the iniquities of the times,
                 delivered him from the following miseries by a quiet,
                 peaceable and sweet departure in the Lord.</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-043"/>



            
            <p>According to his word, he was taken away. But from
                what or why doth God cut short the life of <rs type="person">his servant</rs>?
                Not in anger, surely, against them, although it is said
                 in this text, '<quote xml:id="q-093" type="partial" source="#_Isaiah_57:1">the righteous perisheth</quote>'? </p>
            <p>No, he perisheth from the pleasures of the world and the delights
                 thereof (for the present enjoyments of this life) that he might
                 translate him to a better place and more durable riches.
                 And not only so, but their departure was to be freed
                 even from the evils to come.</p>
            <p>Well might this be applied to our very case, in <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my 
                 dear father's</rs> deliverance: for his eyes did not see
                those great and terrible evils which we did that survived him,
                  even bitter ones that fell upon the whole English and Irish
                 nations, such as was never heard of the like (such horrid
                 treasons, treacheries, bloodsheds, burnings, famines,
                desolations and destructions).</p>
            <p>Which fell so heavily upon <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">our holy, good and pious
                king</rs>, whom the world was not worthy of, and that excellent,

                in faith and doctrine none could parallel since the apostles'
                 time).  And surely these things was foreseen 
                 several years before by him: he laid out his endeavours
                 to prevent the falling of them upon us by his frequent
                 admonishments and reproofs for their vanities,
                 with his zealous prayers and deep humiliation of his person
                 and daily intercessions at the <quote xml:id="q-094" type="phrase" source="#_Hebrews_4:16">throne of grace</quote> for <rs type="place">these

            <p>but, our sins crying so loud in general for
                vengeance, that the Lord would not spare those which
                 offended with so high a hand against the sweet
                 mercies and forbearance of our gracious God.
                Yet, notwithstanding all those calamities and distractions of those times, I must ever acknowledge 
                 and set forth the loving kindness, mercies and goodness
                 of the Lord of Hosts to us in our deliverances in all

                 And though in much frights by alarms from

                thus did the Lord deliver <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs> in this
                 way, the best of all: most certainly it was, for
                 there the weary be at rest and <quote xml:id="q-097" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_Job_3:17">the wicked cease from troubling </quote>. He died and was gathered to his Father's in a 
                quiet and peaceable time; as he lived in peace, so
                 he departed in peace and to peace, <quote xml:id="q-098" type="allusion" source="#_Proverbs_3:24">giving him rest in his
                sleep: the sweet sleep of death</quote> to him though sad 
                 to us he left behind him.</p>
            <p>It follows in the <ref source="#_Isaiah_57:2">second verse</ref>: <quote xml:id="q-099" type="direct" source="#_Isaiah_57:2">He shall enter into peace:
                 they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in
                 his uprightness</quote>.</p>
            <p>When the righteous man leaves this turbulent
                 world, whither shall he go or what place has
                 God prepared for him? Lo, the spirit of God tells
                us by his prophet here the place: <quote xml:id="qx-100" type="direct" source="#_Isaiah_57:2">he shall enter
                    into peace, they shall rest in their beds</quote>.</p>
            <p>And in this change of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> was fulfilled
                 this prophecy, which had been confirmed by our dear

                 to the pure in heart, for they shall see God; the peacemakers , for they shall be called the children of

            <p>Several of these graces — if not all of them — 
                 <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">this dear servant of God</rs> was eminent for; in whose
                 blessings, I trust, he enjoys his share; being called
                 by God to work in his vineyard young, he fitted
                 him for his place here that he might obtain
                 a crown in heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p>Many received a blessing in his peaceable and
                 meek, humble frame of heart; being a great means
                and instrument of reconciliation in his time to public and private families, which were partakers of the
                 benefits received thereby. </p>
            <p>Therefore, I hope in that God of peace, whose servant
                he was, that he now also rests himself. In his death,
                 he shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their
                beds; their grave shall be a bed of honour. To him,
                 it is so: <quote xml:id="q-100" type="partial" source="#_Ecclesiastes_7:1">blessed with a good fame and name which is like
                 the savour of sweet and precious ointment, as Solomon

            <p>Each one, walking in his uprightness — the merciful,
                the just, the upright, the holy, the righteous man — all
                have their abundant blessings (<ref source="#_Matthew_5">Matthew 5)</ref>.</p>

            <p>And these fell upon the head of this good Josiah,
                 whom the Lord had such care of to deliver him from
                 those evils following his death: in that his eyes
                 did not behold the evils which he brought upon this land.
                 In all these things, we have cause to bless our
                gracious and heavenly Father in fulfilling his word
                to him that is in this text.</p>
            <p>Making him happy in his name and memory to posterity, living happily here and dying in the peace

                 in his own conscience and soul abundance of tranquillity,
                 having walked uprightly all his days; and now
                this diligent labourer of God was, at last, called
                 by his Lord and has received of him his hire,</p>
            <p> even the wages of eternal glory, with his Lord and God to
                 behold that fair beauty and <quote xml:id="q-102" type="phrase" source="#_1Corinthians_13:12">see him face to face</quote>
                 and live with him forever. Now <quote xml:id="q-103" type="partial" source="#_1Corinthians_15:54">mortality has put on

            <p>Thus, have we seen that God is able and frequently
                 doth make it appear that the death of the righteous
                 servants of God are exceeding great blessings, and a
                 happiness to themselves when he gathereth them

            neighbours: for we be commanded to provide for
                 our inferiors by embracing them with a fatherly
                 affection, by providing for their maintenance and
                 education; by instructing them in the fear and nurture
                 of thee, our heavenly Father; by giving them all good
                 examples in our religious and honest carriage and
                 behaviour; by chastising them for their offences.
                And to honour our superiors in heart, word and deed
                 and gesture; to yield all obedience unto them, to
                 imitate their virtues, to express our thankfulness
                 to them in word and deed, and to wink at their 
                 imperfections and infirmities. Contrary to those 
                 duties, we have wanted of that natural affection 
                wherewith we ought to abound; we have neglected
                our duties by contempt, our scorn, too much indulgence
                 and rigour, by lightness and immodesty, and too much
                 boasting. 
                Neither can we excuse ourselves, O Lord,
                
                
                
                from hatred, anger, evil will, desire of revenge, waywardness, peevishness, inhumanity, wrathful looks
                 and such like misbehaviours against our neighbours:
                 whereas thou hast commanded us unfeigned love,
                 one towards another, benevolence, compassion,
                meekness, long-suffering, affability, and all kind of

                 We cannot but likewise acknowledge our lustful concupiscence  — in heart, word and deed — in repeating love songs, filthy talking, all manner of uncleanness, as
                well with ourselves as others. Whereas, on the other side,
                 thou hast enjoined us all chastity; modesty in our 
                actions, words, gesture, attire, behaviour and conversations; moderation at all time in meat, drink,

              sleep and all such like necessaries. And thou hast
            
              
              
                forbidden us all inward grudgings and longing after
                wealth by avarice or coveting other men's riches; all
                    
              fraud, deceit, tricks in bargaining and selling; all
                usury, idleness, niggardise and profusion of thy good creatures: yet have we incurred the breach of all these, thy heavenly
                 directions, by not dealing uprightly with our neighbour in
                 buying and selling; by not caring to save him from damage;
                 by not doing the works of our calling; by not using liberality

                And we must lastly confess, O Lord, against ourselves
                that thou hast enjoined us all plain meaning and
                
            speaking, all taciturnity, grave speech, a moderate use
                 of the tongue, the bearing of a good opinion of our neighbours and judging all things done by him to the best.</p>
            <p>But contrarily, we have delighted ourselves too much
                 in lying, false testimony, prattling, scurrility, defaming and backbiting, sinister suspicion and wrongful

                 to a full maturity, </p>
            <p>which undoubtedly had overwhelmed the whole body of

            <p>When they were met, they fell to drink much — they
                causing him take more that he might be drunk — but
                 he desired them to tell him what they sent to him
                 for. <persName ref="ppl:hm1">MacMahon</persName> clapped him on the back and told

                 and to take effect shortly against the English dogs
                 that could be: to cut their throats and tomorrow, by six

                 ears and not spare one of them.</p>
            <p>After which speech <rs ref="ppl:oc2" type="person">his cousin, the protestant,</rs> started
                 and cried out, 'What shall I do for <rs ref="ppl:xc5" type="person">my wife</rs>?'</p>

                 He might get better of his own country. So, he considering himself to be in their hand, who would murder

            <p>Being come to the gate, he was forced to threaten hard

                 my own soul in their preservation from the Irish who
                 intends to destroy them all'. And told him all the foregoing
                 circumstances, telling him withal that he must not look on
                 him as an idle, drunken fellow but as one which had almost lost his own life to preserve his, and that if he did
                 not take care to prevent this mischief all the innocent
                 blood of the English would be required at his hand, </p>
            <p>with many such like expressions. After which, there was search

                and we all — poor sheep destinated to destruction — was thus

                    About the year 1643 (September 15), we went to see my <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName>
                at <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> and to live a while with her until <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName> was
                
                fitted. And there it pleased God to preserve me from death
                which I was nigh unto by eating a little piece of lobster that day.
                    I had taken physic; for it turned on my first sleep,
                when I wakened, into an exceeding terrible vomiting 
                and purging. And so followed with such violence that they 
                could not make me any help, nor could I have so much 
            

                <pb xml:id="page-084"/>



                
                     
                
                respite or ease until I could take anything, and this
                 continued all that night and <date when-custom="1643-09-16">the next day</date> until night.
                 But by the gracious blessing of God, upon some respite and
                 things given by <persName ref="ppl:xm1">Mr Mahum</persName>, with <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> care,
                 I escaped that desperate fit and by degrees was cured,
                 only it brought me very weak and faint.<anchor xml:id="ev53-end" type="event"/></p>

                 After I was recruited in strength, <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> went to

                And there she was troubled

                was charged — for 18 or 20 months together — with £25<am>l</am> a month

                About this year, <persName ref="ppl:kwd1">my dear and only sister, the Lady 
                 Danby</persName>, drew near her time for delivery of <rs ref="ppl:fd1" type="person">her sixteenth child</rs>
                 (10 whereof had been baptised, the other six were stillborn when she was above half gone with them; she, having miscarried of them all upon frights by fire in her
                 chamber, falls and such like accidents happening). All her
                    children were sons — saving my two nieces, <persName ref="ppl:kdb1">Katherine</persName> and 
                    <persName ref="ppl:ad1">Alice Danby</persName> — and most sweet, beautiful and comely were they
                 all.  The troubles and distractions of those sad times
                 did much afflict and grieve her, who was of a tender and
                 sweet disposition, wanting the company of her husband,
                 <persName ref="ppl:td3">Sir Thomas</persName>, to manage his estate and other concerns.</p>

                <p>But he, being engaged in <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">his king's</rs> service was not

                 until she fell sick. These things, added to the horrid rudeness of the soldiers and Scots quartered then amongst
                    them  which — vexing and troubling her much with frights —
                 caused her to fall into travail sooner than she expected;
                nor could she get <rs type="person">her old midwife</rs>, being then in <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> which was then shut up (for the plague was exceeding great there  so that all the inhabitants that could get

                 receive grand preservation from the divine providence
                    in delivering us from <quote xml:id="q-190" type="partial" source="#_Psalms_91:5">the arrow that flieth by day</quote>, when —

                     so that no infection seized upon anyone that belonged us,

                    done harm by rags, notwithstanding all her charitable
                 relief daily with much meat and money). Blessed be the
                    great and ever merciful Father, who did not deliver
                us up to this heavy judgement of the Lord but did rebuke the destroying angel and at last stayed this plague

                of her body, being feverish. After exceeding sore 
                    travail, she was delivered of a goodly son, <date when-custom="1645-09-03">about September 3</date>, by one <persName ref="ppl:xs4"> Dame

                    a sweet child, that died that summer of the smallpox.</p>
                <p><rs ref="ppl:fd1" type="person">This child</rs> came double into the world, with such extremity
                 that she was exceedingly tormented with pains so that she was

                    frightful slumbers, neither could she eat anything

                Yet, still did she spend her time in discourse of goodness,
                 excellently pious, godly and religious instructing her
                 children and servants, and preparing her soul for her dear
                    redeemer (as it was her saying, she should not be long from
                    him). That week, when I was left with her after my <persName ref="ppl:cda1">lady
                 Armitage</persName> and my <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName> was gone, though she could
                 not get rest, yet all her discourse was very good and profitable to the hearers who might learn piety, chastity,
                 holiness, patience, humility and all how to entertain the
                 pleasure of God with contentedness; making so excellent
                 a confession of faith and other Christian virtues and graces
                 that <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> exceedingly admired her parts and piety,
                 giving her  as high a character as could be.</p>
                <p>She did entreat <persName ref="ppl:td3">Sir Thomas</persName>, her husband, to send for <persName ref="ppl:gf1">Mr

                 but he would not give leave which was to my knowledge a
                 great grief and trouble to her thoughts. That night,
                 she poured out her soul in prayer with such comprehensive
                 and good expressions that could be for her own soul, for pardon
                 and remission of her sins, for grace and sanctification from the

                peace, with such pathetical and jealous expressions that 
                 all did glorify God for things he had done for her.
                 After which, she did in a manner prophesy that God would
                 humble the kingdom by afflictions for their sin and
                 security, but after that, when we were humbled and
                 reformed, whosoever should live to see it (for she should
                 not) should enjoy happy days for church and state.
                Thus, she continued and with prayers for our enemies, et cetera,
                 for they stood in need of our prayers for the forgiveness
                 of all their evils.</p>
            <p>She called <rs type="group">her children</rs>, exhorted them abundantly
                 to fear God, serve him and love one another; be obedient
                to <rs ref="ppl:td3" type="person">their father</rs> with admonishing them and her family;
                she was kind and dearly affectionate to <rs ref="ppl:td3" type="person">her husband</rs> to whom, 
                 under God, she left the care of her seven young children.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, she did express abundant joy in God and
                 would sweetly, with a melodious voice, sing aloud his praise
                 and glory in anthems and psalms proper for her condition, with many sweet verses praising him for all things
. Nor was she in the least concerned to part with her <rs ref="ppl:td3" type="person">husband</rs>
                
                 or children nor anything in this world; having her hope
                 and desires fixed upon God, leaving <rs type="group">her children</rs> freely
                 to the providence of her God, who had relieved her soul
                 out of all her distress, who had promised to be <quote xml:id="q-191" type="partial" source="#_Psalms_68:5">a father
                 to the fatherless</quote>. All her words were full of sweetness
                 and affection, giving me many hearty thanks for all
                 my pains and care I took with her, and watching a whole

            <p>He was a gentleman exceedingly qualified, with suitable
                 endowments both natural and acquired, giving himself over in the qualifications for the service of his God,

                him much beloved and lamented, at home and abroad,
                for the great loss and sad conclusion of so brave a person.
                Yet enjoyed he, in his time after <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> death, not
                 much comfort; for since his return

            <p>After which it was conceived, upon such a crime as
                 loyalty to his God and prince, this privilege of the disposing of this, with the enjoyment of his own estate, was

                 happy, if our own sins, ripe for judgement, had not prevented God's mercies and stirred up the Philistines with the
                 discontented schismatics, instruments for our punishment

            <p> But his enemies' vigilance of all opportunities to gain

                 for a more full oath to their purpose, they were dismissed without any reward save much anger and reproaches for their charges in that journey.</p>
            <p>This dealing much incensed the poor men, who said

                Nevertheless, this formality of the projectors was sufficient ground to proceed against him as a delinquent
                 against the parliament (though according to their own
                rules he was not liable, being underage);  yet where such

            <p><rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">My mother</rs> said that her service and thanks must be returned
                him for all his kindness in that business, which she would have
                done herself by writing but that <milestone xml:id="ev66-start" unit="event"/>she was suddenly surprised,
                 at that instant of his coming up to the chamber, with much
                fears for me (who was so violently tormented with a
                
                 pain in the right side of my neck amongst the sinews and
                 which caused me to cry out in extremity, nor could she
                 imagine what was the cause, only she still anointed it with
                oil of roses).  <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">My brother</rs>, seeing me in such pain,
                asked how it came. Of which I could give no other account,
                having been as well before as ever until I was combing my
                 head toward the right hand and bending my neck as he came
                 up the stairs, and ever since it had held me grievously.
                 This was the circumstances of the strange pain, which held me
                 strongly until about half an hour, which was the very time
                 of his drowning.</p>
            <p>
                But to proceed to the circumstances of himself, he pitied me
                much and would have stayed with me but that <persName ref="ppl:ww1">his uncle William</persName>
                stayed for him at <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> for letters that post. And after his
                 walking three or four turns about the chamber in his studying
                of his business, still methought I saw a great deal of 
                 change. He looked so seriously and soberly as if there was
                 some great change near, but what I knew not: only feared
                the worst that we should be deprived of him whom I so dearly loved.</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-104"/>



            
                
            
            <p>
                He, in a very reverent manner, knelt down and
                asked blessing at his going out again not long before,
                 which <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> took notice of praying God Almighty to bless
                him and said, 'Son, I gave you my blessing but even now, how
                 cometh it that you take so solemn a leave of me?'</p>
            <p>
                He answered, 'Forsooth, I cannot have your prayers and blessing for me too often'. And so, with her prayers for him in his
                preservation and his most humble obeisance, in a dutiful
                manner he took his leave, bidding me, 'Farewell, dear
                sister. I hope to find you better at my return home'.
                I, likewise, prayed him to have a care of himself and,
                looking after him, I thought he had the sweetest aspect
                 and countenance as I ever saw in him. And my 
        [heart]
     was 
                 even full of fears that we should lose him: there was so
                 great and entire an affection for him on whom we did all
                much depend. And speaking of this to him, he said I was
                always full of fears for him but he did not deserve it.
                And this was the last parting we had in this world, with abundance of dear love and affection betwixt us as we ever
                 had in our lives together.<anchor xml:id="ev66-end" type="event"/></p>

            Going after this downstairs, he called for his horse and
                although he had two men my mother kept for him, yet took
                he neither with him, but bid his footman, <persName ref="ppl:jb2">James Brodricke</persName>,
                 an Irish man and an excellent runner, to meet him at
                <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> at eleven o'clock where he was to meet <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William</persName>.
                So, <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my brother</rs> went towards <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">the river</rs>, and as he rid by
                our <rs type="place" ref="place:Hips_023">chapel</rs>, where there was a wedding that day, he asked the
                 people whether <geogName ref="place:Swal_123">the Swale</geogName> might be ridden. They said that 
                 there had been a flood, but it was fallen for some had crossed
                the water that morning. So, he, bidding the people joy in their
                marriage, went very slowly towards <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">the river</rs>.</p>
            <p>
                And as we heard afterwards by two men which saw him on the

                other side, he went down as carefully and slowly as foot
                 could fall. Nor was the second flood come so high until he
                was in the midst of <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">the river</rs> but,  when it comes from <geogName ref="place:Dale_126">the

                <milestone xml:id="ev67-start" unit="event"/>
                 as I can myself testify, who (through the mercies of God)
                was very nigh perishing in <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">that water</rs> once or twice but was
                 delivered.</p>
            <p>For, as I was coming betwixt <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName> and our house at
                <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>, if I had been but two yards of the shore, I had been lost
                by its force but, by providence, I was not above half the
                 horse length 
                    
                
                from
                
                ground and yet the horse was taken to the
                middle girths (albeit, it had been all the time I passed through
                before the flood came down but a little above the fetlock).
                Thus, wondrously was I preserved from drowning. <quote xml:id="q-209" type="partial" source="#GB_1Chronicles_16:35">The

            But to return to the sad relation of <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my brother</rs>, which we was
                informed of by two men which walked beyond <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">the river</rs>.
                 They perceiving a gentleman going down to the water, 
                imagining it some from <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>, seeing afar off that the
                 flood came suddenly and mightily down, made haste to
                <geogName ref="place:Swal_123">the Swale</geogName>, and see only his horse getting out of <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">the river</rs> where
                 he had been tumbled in, all over head, and by swimming had
                 got out and shaked himself.  They got hold of his bridle
                but missed the person that rode on him: perceived it to be his
                horse, made a great search for <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my brother</rs> but could not find the
                 body. With great sorrow and lamentation, they ran to <placeName ref="place:Easb_017">Easby</placeName>
                 and <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> raising all the towns, flocking in exceedingly with
                lamentable mournings and outcries for him whom they doubted
                was lost in <rs ref="place:Swal_123" type="geog">that unhappy river</rs>.</p>
            <p>The most lamentable news came to <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>, where our very

                hearts were almost broken with this grievous, dismal,
                heavy blow. And loss of our dearest brother and for the hearty
                griefs and sorrows I sustained, it well-nigh had brought
                me to have died with him<anchor xml:id="ev68-end" type="event"/> and, if God had seen it fit, that 
                my poor unworthy life might have gone so he might
                 have lived for the good of his family.</p>
            
            <p>And but that the hand of our gracious God was seen mightily in <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> preservation, we had been deprived
                 of her life also. This great blow added to her former
                afflictions and to have brought her with sorrow to her grave,
                 being deprived in such a heavy manner of the hope of
                 her house. A man of so great accomplishments and greatness that I have heard many lament and say that few came
                 near to him for excellent abilities, temperament of
                 body and humours, faculties of mind, ingenious and of great
                 ingenuity. A most obedient and faithful son to his
                 parents which increased their comfort in him.</p>
            <p>A dear and affectionate brother; a faithful friend;
                 a loving landlord; to his very enemies, ever courteous
                 and affable, not disobliging any by his morosity or
                 perverseness.  His very enemies then could not but
                 lament his loss said he was the greatest loss that <placeName ref="place:York_079">Yorkshire</placeName>
                 had for a brave gentleman. And if thus much came from
                 the mouths of adversaries, no encomium his friends can
                 set upon him can speak his worth and merit at whose hands
                 he had deserved so much. And I am sure the country
                 generally had a great loss of one so pious, understanding and loyal to his king, so that, if it might have
                gained him the world, he would not have taken a false
                 oath or covenant to wrong the church or his sovereign.

                 Great and infinite was the search by thousands of people
                 from that time until <date when-custom="1651-04-02">Wednesday following</date>, his body not being found
                 until on that day and about the time when he was lost.</p>
            <p>And then one of those men which was a witness against
                 him was the first which discovered his body, it being fallen
                 into a pool near <placeName ref="place:Catt_009">Catterick Bridge</placeName>, above a mile from 
                the place he was drowned: <persName ref="ppl:jp2">John Plummer</persName>, the man's name.</p>
            <p>After they had drawn him up, care was taken of his
                 body, which was as sweet and comely in all parts as in his life,
                 except one bruise on the nose which was thought to be done
                 when he fell upon some great stone, there being abundance in that wath place.
                    
                Albeit he was an excellent swimmer
                yet was it not the Lord's pleasure that it did him any help to
                 be saved thereby.<anchor xml:id="ev69a-end" type="event"/>

            After many troubles and afflictions, under which it 
                 pleased God to exercise <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> and self in, since the death
                 of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs>, she was desirous to see me comfortably 
                 settled in the estate of marriage in which she hoped to receive some satisfaction; finding age and weakness to seize
                 more each year, which added a spur to her desires for the
                 future well-being of her children according to everyone
                 of their capacities.</p>
            
            <p>
                As to myself, I was exceedingly satisfied in that happy
                and free condition wherein I enjoyed in that time, with delight abundantly
                in the service of my God and the obedience I owed to such an excellent parent, in whose enjoyment I accounted my days
                 spent with great content and comfort. The only fears which 
                 possessed me was lest I should be deprived of that great
                 blessing I had in her life; nor could I without much reluctancy draw my thoughts to the change of my single life,
                knowing too much of the cares of this world sufficiently
                 without the addition of such incident to the married estate.</p>
            <p>As to the fortune left by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs>, it was fair and more
                than competent, so that I needed not fear by God's blessing
                 to have been troublesome to my friends, but to be rather in a 
                condition to assist them, if need had required,</p>
            <p> especially more, in regard that I was confident of what
                 <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> could do for me (living) and at her death.
                <anchor xml:id="ev72a-end" type="event"/>
                So that to show my dear affection towards <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother, 
                 George</persName>, in the time of his straits — for his better help in
                his estate, being sore burdened with debts, annuities, et cetera — 
                 I was willing to transfer £500<am>l</am> of my English portion
                 to be received out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> which would have eased that

            <pb xml:id="page-118"/>



            
                 
            
           <p> the same: by reason that both the sequestration was taken
                off and the wardship money of <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">his brother</rs> denied to be paid to <persName ref="ppl:eo1">Sir
                    Edward Osborne's</persName> executor, and that he was better by £200<am>l</am>
                 a year in his estate, with many other considerable arguments arising towards <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> and myself
                (for there was such unhandsome dealings to us, not to
                say dishonest, since <rs ref="ppl:cw2" type="person">my brother's</rs> marriage as could neither
                 induce her or myself, to part with our estates without security).</p>
            
            <p>But I shall be silent in these things, which afforded us
                 too much troubles and sorrows, wishing rather to cover
                 all things of the nature of disputes betwixt such near
                 relations.</p>
            <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev72c-start" unit="event"/>
                And withal <persName ref="ppl:jw1">my youngest brother, John</persName>, being fallen into
                 a grievous distemper through grief, upon harsh dealing
                after the marriage of <persName ref="ppl:cw2">my brother Christopher</persName> (who, by ill counsel
                 given him, detained his right of annuity of £100<am>l</am> per annum
                to his great prejudice). And <persName ref="ppl:jw1">John</persName> was likely thereby to leave
                 both that £100<am>l</am> in <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> with his whole fortune (then descending upon John, by his brother <persName ref="ppl:gw1">George</persName> his death) of £6000 out of the

            <p>Weighing all these reasons together, and that I had no
                 maintenance from <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName> as I ought to have
                had by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> will but was willing to forego that to
                <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William Wandesford</persName> towards the payment of debts,
                 I had no reason from all these considerations to lose
                 the payment of the said £500<am>l</am> out of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>.</p>
            <p>
                Yet, I do believe from hence proceeded much displeasure
                 that I would not consent to wrong myself of the whole,
                insomuch that after the business of sequestration was
                cleared, he desisted the acting anything in my behalf.</p>

                Nevertheless, such was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> affection to the
                 family, for its preservation, that she harkened to the proposal made for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> marriage (albeit therein she disobliged some persons of very good worth and quality
                 which had solicited her earnestly in my behalf, and such
                 as were of large and considerable estates of her neighbours
             about her). And after the first and second view betwixt us,
                 she closed so far with him that she was willing he should 
                proceed in his suit, and that cordially, if I should see cause to accept.

            <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev73a-start" unit="event"/>
            
                For my own particular, I was not hasty to change my 
                 free estate without much consideration, both as to my 
                 present and future: the first inclining me rather to continue
                so still, wherein none could be more satisfied.</p>
            <p>The second would contract much more trouble, twisted
                 inseparably with those comforts God gave in that estate.
                 Yet might I be hopeful to serve God in those duties incumbent on a wife, a mother, a mistress and governess
                in a family. And if it pleased God so to dispose of me
                in marriage, making me a more public instrument of
                 good to those several relations, I thought it rather duty
                 in me to accept my friends' desires for a joint benefit than
                 my own single retired content, so that Almighty God
                might receive the glory of my change and I more capacitated to serve him in this generation in what he thus called
                me unto.  </p>
            <p>Therefore, it highly concerned me to enter into this greatest change of my life with abundance of fear and caution:
                not lightly, nor unadvisedly, nor— as I may take my
                God to witness that knows the secret of hearts — <quote source="#BCP,_Solemnization_of_Matrimony" xml:id="q-244" type="paraphrase">I did it not

                And to that end, that I might have a blessing upon
                 me in all my undertakings, I poured out my petitions
                 before the God of my life to direct, strengthen, lead
                 and counsel me what to do in this concern which so
                 much tended to my future comfort or discomfort.</p>

                towards it. But if otherwise it were best for me to be,

                would in mercy give me such a one to be my husband
                as might be an holy, good and pious Christian, understanding, wise and affectionate that we might live in his
                 fear and favour, praying him to give unto me suitable
                 graces and qualifications which should fit me for that
                calling. And this, for our saviour's sake, I humbly begged
                in Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>
            <p>
                After which petitions to my God, I was the more inclined to
                 accept of this proposition of my friends, finding also
                that the gentleman seemed to be a very godly, sober and
                 discreet person, free from all manner of vice and of a 
                 good conversation. This was the greatest encouragement
                 to me when I considered the general decay of true
                 religion, in profession and practice, especially in the gentry
                and with men of quality (too many being given to a sad
                 course of life through debauchery) made me more
                 cautious in choosing,  fearing to meet with such as
                 neither knew God nor cared for their souls to preserve themselves in a holy course of life and conversation.
                 Nor could I ever have enjoyed comfort in this world to
                have been matched with the greatest estates</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-121"/>



            
                
            
            <p>or fortunes had I wanted that first and principal qualification in a husband  which is to be regarded above all

            I cannot deny that his estate, which was then favourably given
                into <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>, was the least in value which had been offered,
                 yet did <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> hope to find a handsome competency
                 without much charge as was represented to her: only
                 the want of a house which he must build, <rs type="person">his brother</rs> and <rs type="person">sister</rs>
                being provided for by <rs ref="ppl:edg1" type="person">his mother</rs>, that would clear his
                 estate which was given in to be £600<am>l</am> per annum.</p>
            <p>
                This was very well, considering the addition of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
                    father's</rs> portion given me by his will and deeds (namely,
                 £1500 out of <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> at <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName> and £1000 to be
                paid out of his Irish estate of <placeName ref="place:Cast_085">Idough</placeName>) which would be
                an addition to increase <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> revenues. 
                Also, <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> was willing to give me what
                 assistance she could out of her love and affection.
            </p>
            <p>
                 This treaty of marriage with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was very 
                 earnestly pursued by himself and friends, and as discreetly  managed by <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> as she could.
                For she was, in a manner, left alone by all our relations,
                especially after <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my brother's</rs> death, in regard that self-interest too far prevailed for those to hinder my
                 disposal to any person by the 
                 which they would be deprived
                 of their sinister expectations of my fortune. </p>
            <p>
                But, through God's blessing, this treaty was brought
                 to a period to the satisfaction of each party and with a
                 general consent, and the articles of marriage drawn
                up by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> (for the right settlement of all things
                 concluded upon betwixt <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> in my behalf and himself) were both just and honest done by him.</p>

            <p>As for the security of my portion: he was to receive

                dispose of for himself and his own use, being secured to me.
                 And for the £1000 payable out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, he gave
                 bond to <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> to purchase land of inheritance
                 for me during my life, and for my children at my
                 decease.</p>
            <p>And withal, <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> was willing to give us our table
                 with all our family for three years: these were the terms

            After which agreements, articles and writings done, there

                 wholly this business was left to my own choice what

      but <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was very much troubled upon this unjust denial of <rs ref="ppl:gg1" type="person">his father-in-law</rs>, by which he was likely
                 to have undone his desires, fell into much sadness and
                 discontent, which perhaps might hasten his sickness that

                a godly and religious husband with whom I might, through
                his blessing, spend the rest of my days. And to this purpose,
                 I poured out my humble petitions and requests with hearty
                thanks and praise for all my deliverances (both spiritual
                and temporal) ever since I was born to that present hour;
                beseeching him that as he in abundant mercy had heard
                 my unworthy requests in the beginning of this treaty, so
                 he would now multiply his free grace and loving kindness to me, his vile creature, giving both to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>
                 and myself all those graces and spiritual comforts we

                 this band of wedlock, being instruments of each other's salvation. And if it were the divine pleasure to give us the comfort of
                 children, they might be heirs of the kingdom of heaven
                when he should call them and, in this life, instruments of building up his church and the raising up of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> family.
                But this temporal blessing, as all others of that nature, with subserviency to his wisdom and good pleasure that, if he saw it

            That very day on which I was married, having been in health
                
                
                 and strength for many years before, I fell suddenly so ill
                 and sick, after two o'clock in the afternoon that I thought,
                and all that saw me did believe, it would have been my last 
                night; being surprised with a violent pain in my head and
                stomach, causing a great vomiting and sickness at my 
        [heart]
    
                 which lasted eight hours before I had any intermission. But,
                 blessed be the Lord our God, the <quote xml:id="q-247" type="phrase" source="#_2Corinthians_1:3">Father of mercies</quote>, <quote xml:id="q-248" type="allusion" source="#_2Corinthians_1:4">which had
                     compassion on me</quote> and, by the means that was used, I was strengthened wonderfully beyond expectation , being pretty
                well about ten o'clock at night. <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">My dear husband</rs>,
                with <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>, was exceeding tender over me which was a
                 great comfort to my spirits.  What the cause of this fit
                 was I could not conjecture, save that I might have brought
                it upon me by cold taken the night before, when I sat
                 up late in preparing for the next day and washing my feet
                 at that time of the year, which <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> did believe was the
                cause of that dangerous fit the next day.</p>

            <p>But, however, it was or from what cause it proceeded,
                 I received a great mercy in my preservation from God
                 and shall ever acknowledge the same in humble gratitude
                for his infinite, loving kindness forever.</p>
            <p>I looked upon this first beginning of my new condition
                 to be a little discouragement, <quote xml:id="q-249" type="partial" source="#_Romans_8:28">although God was able

                of this world, nor in the comforts of a loving husband
                whom God had given me, but set my desires more up
                 on the love of my Lord and God.

            <p>In his return home from <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, his own estate, I was

                 where I passed down on foot a very high hill, betwixt
                <geogName ref="place:Hood_121">Hood Hill</geogName> and <geogName ref="place:Whit_127">Whitestone Cliff</geogName>, which is above a mile steep down.
                And indeed, so bad that I could not scarce tread the narrow steps
                 which was exceeding bad for me in that condition, and sore to endure the way so strait, and none to lead me but <rs type="person">my maid</rs>
                 which could scarce make shift to get down herself. All our
                 company being gone down before, each step did very much
                strain me, being so big with child, nor could I have got down
                 if I had not then been in my full strength and nimble on foot. </p>
            <p>But I bless God, I got down safe at last, though much tired

                 pains after my walk. <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would not have

            This was the first occasion which brought me a great deal of
                misery and killed <rs ref="ppl:xt1" type="person">my sweet infant</rs> in my womb. For I continued in all pain by fits upon this journey and <date>within a fortnight</date>
                fell into a desperate fever at <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>. Upon which my old doctor,
                <persName ref="ppl:xm1">Mr Mahum</persName>, was called but could do little towards the cure
                because of being with child. I was willing to be ordered by him, but
                 said I found it absolutely necessary to be let blood if they
                would save my life. But I was freely willing to resign my

            <p>Nor was I wanting to supplicate my God for direction what to

                 was turned very bad by my sickness. But I found a

                set forth the mercy of my ever-gracious God, who had blessed
                 the means in such manner: who can sufficiently extol

                 the notion of a free parliament.</p>

            that he vouchsafed her the honour to be instrumental
                 for the relief and support of such as were precious in 
                 his sight.</p>
            <p>I have formerly made a discourse of her travels and
                 several accidents that befell <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">her person</rs> and family after
                 <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> death until she came to live at her jointure
                at <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>, and also what troubles and trials losses,
                 and crosses, she underwent almost all the time she lived
                 there (as well as from the unnatural actions and unkindness of friends, which had repining thoughts that she should
                 enjoy her jointure, as from the public enemies and
                 disturbances from the public calamities of church
                 and state).</p>
            <p>All which she endured with a noble and invincible spirit,
                 being fortified by her religion and the testimony of
                 a good conscience that she laid out herself for
                 God's service and glory, and the good of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> whole
                 family and the general benefit of Christians amongst whom she lived; yea, even in those sad times of
                 losing all, many hundreds were relieved and supplied at
                 her door.</p>
            <p>For her exceeding kindnesses done for the help of <rs ref="ppl:cw2" type="person">the heir</rs>,
                 younger children and debtors of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs>, let her
                 own narration, delivered from her in writing before
                 witnesses, declare what and how she expended upon
                 that account. (She, being in a manner compelled to
                 leave such a testimony from some unworthy prejudice
                 which said she did not much from her estate for them.)</p>
            <p>But it was requisite for such an act of kindness,
                 which she did spending all she received upon us, that it should
                 not be forgotten by that family who received so grand
                 a blessing in her life and preservation, without the which it is too
                 probable that we might have been made merchandise of.</p>

            <p>Should I forget her unparalleled wisdom, goodness, 
                 tenderness, love and parental affection by which she governed all her gracious actions towards us in our maintenance and education, <quote xml:id="q-448" type="paraphrase" source="#_1Timothy_5:8">I should be worse than an infidel 
                 who had forsaken the faith</quote> and been ungrateful to that God which

                 crib</quote> would rise up in judgement against me.</p>
            <p>Therefore, do I desire — in point of gratitude to God, my 
                Father, and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">that gracious mother</rs> whom he gave me — to mention those great mercies we received from her in general,
                 and in particular for those exceeding goodness and favours
                 wherein she extended her bounty towards me.</p>
            <p>Who was pleased to provide an habitation for me after
                 her decease and disposed me in marriage. After which, I, with
                 <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and children, did live with her eight years after
                 my marriage, bringing forth <rs ref="ppl:xt1 ppl:atc1 ppl:et1 ppl:ktp1" type="person">four of my children</rs> in her house
                and had all manner of charges, expenses and household
                 affairs in sicknesses, births, christenings and burials of
                and concerning ourselves and children, with the diet, et cetera, of 
                 nurses, men servants and maids, and our friends entertainments: all things done of her own cost and charges all her
                 days while she lived which could not be of less value to
                 us clearly
                 than £1600.
            </p>
            <p>And no small addition of help to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> estate
                 was her disposal of her real estate in land, which she
                 had purchased for £550<am>l</am>, settling it upon myself and my 
                 children.</p>
            <p>Also, her exceeding affection extended itself in her
                settling all her personal estate by deeds of gift and her
                last will and testament, saving her debts and legacies and
                 funerals in feoffees in trust for the use of myself, 
                 <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">husband</rs> and children. All which I confess far exceeding my
                 merit but not her entire affection for my constant
                 being with her in her sorrows and solitudes.</p>
            <p>And albeit she had, in our minorities, disbursed upon us
                 out of her own jointure, which should have been done out of
                 <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName> the sum of £2000.</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-164"/>



            
                
            
            <p>The sum of £2000 besides, above £500<am>l</am> to <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother
              George</persName>, the heir, with the payment of £300<am>l</am> debt of that estate
              and the loss of all <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> personal estate given her
                by will, as also her loss of her annuity of £300<am>l</am> per annum
              out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, to the value due unto her at her death
            
            
                
             
        
                the sum of 300 per annum, which never received any part
                thereof. Yet, notwithstanding all the aforesaid goodness
                of hers to that estate, there wanted not some who put
                 
                 hard thoughts into <persName ref="ppl:gw1">the heir's</persName> mind that she dealt hard
                 by because she did not give all her widow's patrimony
                to him (when as all her former helps did redound 
                 to his benefit, and withal they knew our estate was more
                 burdened at that time which might require such 
                 helps from her because we were contented, for the
                 ease of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>, to receive my portion from thence
                yearly and not in an entire sum).</p>
            <p>Besides this, she fitted <persName ref="ppl:jw1">my youngest brother, John Wandesford</persName>,
                 with the opportunity of good schools (as <placeName ref="place:Beda_001">Bedale</placeName>, <placeName ref="place:Ches_137">Chester</placeName>,
                 <placeName ref="place:Rich_138">Richmond</placeName>) with all other provisions of maintenance and

                under the tuition of <persName ref="ppl:rw3">Dr Widdrington</persName> in <placeName ref="place:Chri_014">Christ's College</placeName>,
                 maintaining him there all the time which, by reason of 
                 a sore fever that seized on him there, he cost her after
                 the rate of above £100<am>l</am> per annum.</p>
            <p>All which time his annuity lay dormant in the estate of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
                 father</rs>, which I suppose was some advantage to the heir.
                 In fine, great and many were the good and charitable acts
                 <persName ref="ppl:aow1">this most dear and excellent mother</persName> of ours did to us
                 all: she so wisely and justly disposing her estate

                but bless God for her wise dispensation,</p>
            <p> being truly thankful for the safe protection care and
                 preservation we enjoyed under her wing.</p>

            <p>In all our sad times of calamity which our eyes beheld,
                 she, restraining and moderating her own expenses most
                 frugally and good housewifery that she neither lived in a penurious but a noble, handsome, manner: to whom both our
                 friends and her own was freely entertained and welcomed.
                Her poor tenants was more happy in her than many
                 of her bordering neighbours, who, although exceeding
                 poor at her first coming, yet by God's blessing upon
                 her discreet ordering her affairs in her estate that the
                 tenants grew rich after little time in those distractions,
                 and since have infinitely bewailed her loss whose person
                living they had so great an honour for.</p>
            <p>It was very observable that she outlived those sad
                troubles upon the kingdom in part, though not until the
                 restoration of our happy <persName ref="ppl:cs2">King Charles II</persName>, whose coming was daily prayed for and heartily wished. And
                 the last soldiers which quartered at <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName> proved

                and, within a short time, the mighty power and providence of
                 God turned the minds and hearts of the people as a mighty
                 river towards its own channel. After her disease, which
                 she had put up so many prayers to God for and would have
                been a joyful day for her to have lived to seen,</p>

            It pleased God to visit my dear and honoured mother,
                 the <persName ref="ppl:aow1">Lady Wandesford</persName>, with her last sickness upon
                 <date when-custom="1659-11-17">Friday the 17th of November 1659</date>, beginning then with an
                 exceeding great cough which tormented her body with
                 stitches in her breast, and troubled her with short
            

            <pb xml:id="page-166"/>



            
                 
            
            breathing. These stitches continued about 14
                 days together hindering her from almost any sleep
                 or rest insomuch that it was wonderful how she
                 could subsist. But upon the use of bags with 
                 fried oats, butter and chamomile chopped laid to her
                sides, the stitches removed, and the cough abated as to
                 the extremity thereof.</p>
            <p>But then she was seized with a more dangerous symptom of a hard lump contracted in her stomach
                 that laid on her heart, with great pain and rising up
                 to her throat, almost stopping her breath when she
                 either swallowed anything or laid to sleep,
                 which lump was conceived to be contracted
                 of wind and phlegm in the stomach for lack of
                 voidance.</p>
            <p>She had also an exceeding sore throat and 
                 mouth, so that she was deprived of the benefit of eating or swallowing almost any kind of food, save
                 a little drop of beer being the most she took inwardly for four or five days and that but with a syringe.
                 Her tongue and mouth, at first, was black; then it
                 turned white, so that with the pains <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs>
                 took in washing and cleansing, the skin came off
                 and was red until the blood came (this continuing until,
                 in the end, her mouth grew white all over).<anchor xml:id="ev119-end" type="event"/></p>

                 ease or sleep for about a week. In which time, as
                 also in all the rest of her sickness, she expressed
                 extraordinary patience: still saying, <quote xml:id="q-451" type="allusion" source="#_James_5:11">it was the
                     Lord that sent it to her and none else could take it from

            <p>Often would she say that the way to heaven was by the
                 <quote xml:id="q-452" type="phrase" source="#_Matthew_16:18">gates of hell</quote>, and that <quote xml:id="q-453" type="partial" source="#_Revelation_5:5">the lion of the tribe of Judah would
                 deliver her</quote>. Likewise, would she frequently break
                out and say, with <quote xml:id="q-454" type="phrase" source="#_2Samuel_23:1">the sweet psalmist of Israel</quote> in the midst of her inexpressible pains and torments, <quote xml:id="q-455" type="direct" source="#BCP_Psalter_Psalm42:6">Why art

            <p>She frequently repeated the 71st Psalm, which she said
                was penned for old age. Surely, she was a great example and pattern of piety, faith, patience; of fortitude
                 and resolution to <quote xml:id="q-459" type="paraphrase" source="#_Ephesians_6:16">withstand all the fiery darts of Satan</quote>
                 which he, in her weakness, cast to affright and hinder
                 her journey to heaven. But he, in whom she put her 
                 whole confidence and served from her youth up, did
                 not now leave her in extremity but so assisted her
                 in soul and spirit that it was an heavenly sight to the
                 beholders even to her last period. And notwithstanding
                all her torments, still she put forth herself — for the
                glory of God and the good of her family and beholders —
                 in good instructions, severe reproofs for all sins in
                 general, with a continual praying to God and praising
                 him in psalms suitable for her condition, speaking
                 to God in his own phrase and word: saying that we could
                 not speak to him from ourselves in such an acceptable a manner as by that which was dictated by his own
                 most Holy Spirit. She often desired her friends to
                 pray with her, and for her, and told them that she desired that
                 they would not pray for her continuance in this life
                 for she was weary of it and desired to obtain a better
                 and to be fitted for it. And that these should be the heads
                on which they should petition God for her. Videlicet:

            <p>It was very observable in all her sickness, as indeed she was not wanting of her gratitude to God 
                 for his exceeding testimonies of his love and mercy
                 to her in all her preservations and deliverances of
                 her and her children, which she very often repeated, 
                severally enumerated, in her best health; so was
                 it now, in her grand weakness and torment even until
                 her death, still the subject of her discourse; calling
                 to mind the wonderful and infinite goodness of God to
                 her even from her childhood; setting forth his 
                 favours to her soul and spiritual mercies innumerable which she particularly mentioned. And then 
                 she mentioned all her manifold preservations and
                 deliverances of her person from death and destruction,
                 making such an excellent catalogue of all that it was 
                 a great consolation to the hearers. And proved by these
                things — as a great argument of the support of her drooping spirits now at the hour of death, being a strong
                bar of defence against her spiritual adversaries —</p>
            <p> that God had appeared gloriously for her that was his
                 servant, who had delivered her from time to time
                 whenever she called on him: her Lord never forsaking
                her but brought her to <quote xml:id="q-466" type="phrase" source="#_Psalms_9:13 #_Job_38:17 #KJV_Psalms_107:18">the gates of death</quote> in a happy old
                 age and to the sight of heaven where she fain would be.
                 And in him she alone trusted, through the merits of Christ,
                he would still deliver her from hell and sin and Satan and
                 preserve her to his kingdom; there to live with him forever, where she might spend the whole eternity of praise
                 and thanksgiving and hallelujahs of glory to the blessed Trinity.
                 Until which time, she was thirsting and longing and <quote xml:id="q-467" type="paraphrase" source="#_Philippians_1:23">desirous to be

            <p>For nothing of this world, nor in it, could hinder
                 her fixedness for heaven; nor indeed, did the concerns of this life come into her thoughts, saving to leave
                 her pious and Christian instructions and holy admonitions amongst us, her children and servants, and to learn
                 by her how to live well and die happily, joyfully and comfortably embracing and often calling for death to let her
                 into the enjoyment of her Lord.</p>
            <p>She had made several times in her sickness, upon occasion of ministers visiting her, many very excellent
                 confessions of her faith and profession of those Christian
                 foundations upon which our faith was built, and of her
                true zeal to the service of God in his holy ordinances
                of our most pious and Christian Church of England,
                wishing us and charging, as we would escape the danger
                 of damnation, not to dishonour that great God whom we
                 served by renouncing that faith and profession which
                 was taught us by the holy clergy and bishops of
                 England; never to listen to the insinuations of any 
                factious, new doctrines whatever but serve God 
                truly and sincerely therein, and he would accept of our
                souls and we should be happy; if not in this world, yet
                 hoped in a better; and that she did believe that — if we
                 humbled ourselves for the abominable sins of this nation
                and pray to God faithfully and serve him sincerely in 
        [heart]
     —
                 God would return in mercy and restore his decayed

            <p>Praying heartily, we might be delivered from popery,
                which these divisions and schisms might tend to if not
                 prevented by the all-wise providence of Almighty God.
                 As to her own particular: she blessed God for making
                 known to her the truth and preserving her therein, declaring
                 that she made it her constant endeavour to walk therein
                 all her days, having her direction and guidance from God.</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-171"/>



            
                
            
            <p>And now she found the comfort of his service and the hopes of
                the rewards of his grace, which he gave her through out the course
                of her life and felt the sweetness of influences upon her
                 soul; for which she most humbly rendered all the powers and
                 faculties of her heart in thanks and praise to his name and
                mercy forever.</p>
            
            <p>
    
            She poured out her fervent, admirable prayers to her God
                 for all her children and relations, begging for each particular child those graces and gifts they wanted, and forgiveness to all who had anyway wronged or injured
                her in all her life (naming some — who had more nearly and
                highly wronged and grieved her — with the <quote xml:id="q-468" type="phrase" source="#KJV_1John_3:17">bowels of compassion</quote>
                 for the good of their souls that they may repent and be forgiven

            <p>
                As to my own private concerns, she petitioned God that
                 I might  find comfort in <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> family
                 and be rewarded with the same blessing that God had been graciously
                 pleased to give me in my children, as she was pleased to say
                 I had been to her. And that I might be strengthened by his 
                 grace to endure those afflictions with patience which I must
                 find in this world after her death, and that I might have hope
                 in God's mercies that he would lay no more on me than he would
                 enable me to undergo and that they were signs of his love to me.
                 And that I must not grieve too much for her loss, since the Lord had
                 continued her so long to me; for he could make up her loss
                in a greater comfort by giving me a son which I wanted, and
                 that I was then with child of one; wished me continue as I
                 had begun and then we should receive each other with joy in
                 heaven which she was confident of through the merits of Jesus Christ,
                according to his speech to St John, '<quote xml:id="q-470" type="paraphrase" source="#_Revelation_2:10">Be thou faithful and I will
                 give thee a crown of life</quote>', with abundance of other heavenly,
                 rich expressions that I am not able to write down.</p>
            <p>She told me she had fully finished her will and settled her
                 estate according as she
            

            <pb xml:id="page-172"/>



            
                 
            
                desired, and she hoped with a good conscience settling all
                 she had in such a manner as would breed no trouble. And
                 that she hoped her son, <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Christopher</persName>, would be satisfied
                with it because she had not been awanting in the discharge
                 of a good conscience towards him ever since he was born 
                (by taking pains with him and care of him in his minority,
                 and disbursing the greater part of her widow's estate
                 upon him or for his brother <persName ref="ppl:jw1">John</persName>, or the other part of
                 <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>, whereby he had the benefit of her maintaining the children). And that now he would let me enjoy with
                 <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and children what she had done for us,
                considering my husband's estate needed it and he was
                heir of a great, large estate of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">his father's</rs>, and by her
                 death that jointure came in clear to him. All which estate
                 would amount to yearly to him in <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> and <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>
                 £3000 which she prayed God to bless to
                 him and his posterity that they might enjoy it in righteousness
                 so long as the moon and sun endureth.</p>
            <p>And now, she said, '<quote xml:id="q-471" type="paraphrase" source="#_2Timothy_4:7 #_John_17:4">I have done my work and finished my

            <date when-custom="1659-12-08">
                About Thursday night</date>, she sent for her children to
                 take her last farewell in this life. When <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>

                 and refreshment upon such occasions.</p>
            <p>After which prayer she embraced us all severally in her

                blessing to his children</quote> — she begged of God Almighty
                 for us all; after which, I took the saddest last leave of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my
                     dear and honoured mother</rs> as ever child did to part with 
                 so great and excellent a parent and infinite comfort.</p>
            <p>And yet, the great grief I had was increased by 
                 reason of her exceeding torment which she endured, which
                 made me more willingly submit to part with her, who
                 I saw endured much pains and extremity, not desiring she should long endure that which it was the pleasure of
                 God for the exercise of her patience to lay on her.
                 Also, when she see me weep much, for this affliction of
                 hers, did indeed concern me nearly.</p>
            <p>She said, 'Dear child, why will you not be willing
                 to part with me to God? Has he not lent me to be a comfort
                 to you long enough? Oh, part with me freely, as I desire to
                 enjoy my saviour in heaven; do not be unwilling that 
                 I should be delivered from this miserable world. Give
                me willingly and freely to him that lent me thus long and be
                 contented in everything. You never have been disobedient to me in all your life. I pray thee obey me in                this that <quote xml:id="q-474" type="paraphrase" source="#_James_4:7">you submit cheerfully to the wise and good determination of our good God </quote>. And fill your heart with spiritual
                comfort instead of this: in me, he takes to himself. <quote source="#BCP,_Holy_Communion,_Prayer_at_Departure" xml:id="q-475" type="allusion">And
                 so, the blessing of God Almighty be upon the head of you and
                 yours forever. Amen</quote>'.</p>
            <p>Certainly, the words of a dying friend prevails much
                 and I do believe the Lord had put words of persuasion into
                 her mouth, which prevailed more than all the world with me to
                 moderate my excessive sorrow and build me up in hopes, as
                 she said, of our meeting again, never to part, which so 
                 happened: for I was, after this, even desirous, that if it were
                 the determinate pleasure of God to take her from my head,
                 that I might patiently submit when he should free that sweet
                 soul from all those burdens of pressures and extremities.</p>

            <p>It pleased God she continued <date when-custom="1659-12-10">until Saturday</date>. About

                see her, when she saluted her gladly, bidding her,  'welcome, dear sister'. What comfort is it to me to see my

                 there ever having been a strict league of affection and
                 friendship betwixt them. She was then come to see her make

                made it be read all over before her: confirming and

                A Thanksgiving for the Restoration of <persName ref="ppl:cs2">King Charles

            After the Lord had taken <rs ref="ppl:wt2" type="person">my child</rs> from me, I had
                 some weakness upon my body by reason of the return
                 of my milk but, in much mercy, I was restored to 
                 a pretty degree of strength and staying at <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName>
                 until I was perfectly recovered.</p>
            <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev134-start" unit="event"/>
            In this time, we had that grand blessing to the whole
                 nation given to us in the restoration of our dread sovereign Lord, <persName ref="ppl:cs2">King Charles</persName> when we, each moment, feared
                 ruin and destruction. Being in that concern so wisely
                 and prudently ordered through the providence of God that —
                 notwithstanding the opposition of the soldiery and other
                great factions — yet was he brought into his own
                 kingdom, city of <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> and parliament in great peace
                 and exceeding much joy from all parts of the kingdom,
                 without the power of one dog that durst open his mouth or the
                 loss of one drop of bloodshed in the whole kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>A main instrument of our deliverance was <persName ref="ppl:gm1">General
                 Monck</persName>, whose faithful heart God stirred up to be instrumental
                 for this blessed change, desiring to join with the consent of
                 the best in the nation who petitioned him for a free parliament.

            All the way, as he came out of <placeName ref="place:Scot_095">Scotland</placeName> from following the
                 factious army of <persName ref="ppl:jl2">Lambert</persName> through each county, was he
                 alarmed with their cries and petitions; hoping thereby that
                 this might be the best way to establish peace in church and
                state and reestablish <rs ref="ppl:cs2" type="person">the king</rs> in his throne in honour and safety.</p>
            <p>Thus, by the infinite goodness of God, this was effected accordingly; for, immediately after that parliament was
                called and set, they voted with great alacrity, his majesty's
                return in honour and safety to his kingdom after 12 years
                 banishment or thereabouts.<anchor xml:id="ev134-end" type="event"/> And now the

                 exceeding content and satisfaction with gratitude to the great
                 and eternal God of Gods and king of kings, who had delivered
                our souls and bodies from those thraldoms, restoring his true
                 and faithful doctrine and his vicegerent upon earth to us,
                 which requires our utmost possibility of thanks and praise to our
                 great Lord whom we serve. Oh, that our hearts might never
                 forget what he hath done for us in restoring our king, our

         In this time while I lived there, about <date when-custom="1661-02-09" datingMethod="#JulianMar">Shrove Sunday 1661</date>,
             
             I was in <placeName ref="place:Oswa_130">the church</placeName> when it was a frost and snow; sitting in the minister's
             pews, I felt myself exceeding cold and, by fits, continued until the

            I began a dangerous sickness, which brought me very nigh
                 to death at <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName> (after <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> death)
                 which was caused by that cold I got and agueish temper on <date when-custom="1661-02-09" datingMethod="#JulianMar">the
                     Sunday</date> in the church, causing a very violent vomiting,
                coming greatly upon <date when-custom="1661-02-11" datingMethod="#JulianMar">Shrove Tuesday, February 13, 1661</date>, being
                that day my birthday.</p>
            <p>And so, continuing perpetually in pain and vomiting
                 until I was not able to receive any kind of sustenance,
                 being then fallen into an intermitting fever; so that, at
                 five days end, I was compelled to send for <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName>.</p>
            <p> He saw cause to let me blood, giving me many cordials
                 to strengthen the stomach, but nothing would stay with me
                 until I drank a draught of cold water, which more refreshed
                 my thirsty soul than all what art could give. </p>
            <p>That night, being the <date when-custom="1661-02-17" datingMethod="#JulianMar">17th of February</date>, I did verily believe 
                 should be my last in this life; I being brought into an
                 exceeding weakness and feebleness of body and spirit
                 but most of all into a seeming spiritual desertion 
                from God, which was not to be long endured without sinking
                 under the pressures of the divine displeasure. Which I apprehended, in this my weakness, my eternal state to be in a 
                 lost condition by reason of my sins and Satan's 
                 accusing me falsely from my sorrows and temporal sufferings,
                 casting multitude of doubtings into my heart. As that:
                 surely, <quote xml:id="q-509" type="allusion" source="#_Mark_9:41">I did not belong to God</quote>, and I was not his servant
                 because <quote xml:id="q-510" type="allusion" source="#_Hebrews_12:6">he followed me with such crosses, afflictions, sickness
                 and troubles in this world which seemed to be curses rather than
                 such trials as he used to lay upon those that were his children</quote>.</p>
            
            <p>And that I had <quote source="#BCP,_Holy_Communion,_Exhortation_to_the_Negligent" xml:id="q-511" type="allusion">neglected all those offers and tenders of mercy
                 in his word and sacraments</quote> which he, from time to time, had given
                 me from my youth up in the examples, instructions and admonitions from <rs ref="ppl:cw1 ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear parents</rs> and from his ministers; all his
                 great deliverances and checks, and calls of his spirit with his
                 spiritual and temporal preservations of me innumerable.
                 Yet, said Satan, all these had not wrought a through conversion and change of heart in me to walk according to the motions
                 of God's spirit with that strictness I ought to have done, and that, though
            

            <pb xml:id="page-187"/>



            
                 
            
            I had been kept from the falling into any enormous sins,
                 yet for the least omission of duties or small offences against God or man eternal damnation was due, and that
                 now it was too late to repent or hope because I had neglected  or driven it so long that my life was at an end.</p>
            <p>For aught I know this was my last summons and that, although God was able to have mercy upon me, yet I had
                so often failed my promises and fallen into sins and forgetfulness of God that he now would not have mercy on me
                 at the last hour, as Satan would have persuaded me.
                 These, with many arguments against my poor soul, did
                 <quote xml:id="q-512" type="phrase" source="#_Revelation_12:9 #_Revelation_20:2">the old serpent</quote> seek to destroy my hopes of mercy, and my
                 own weakness and melancholy forming against myself
                 (joining with Satan) in fears because of my unworthiness
                 or ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Lo, in this most sad and heavy condition was I in: not
                 having any soul living that I could open my griefs and thoughts to, nor receive any comfort for my dejected
                 heavy spirit. For that time, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was himself in a sad
                 condition and very melancholy, full of trouble of spirit, nor
                 would I acquaint him lest I should be an aggravation of
                 his trouble. And alas, what could I say in this exigent?
                When the God of mercy by his corrections severe had 
                seemed to forsake me and withdraw his presence; the devil
                accusing — <quote xml:id="q-513" type="phrase" source="#_Revelation_12:10">as he is termed the accuser of the brethren</quote> — my
                 conscience could not excuse me from too many failings.</p>
            <p>My sickness and weakness threatening my desolation each
                 minute and <quote xml:id="q-514" type="paraphrase" source="#_Lamentations_1:21">I had none to give me spiritual comfort</quote>
                 and <quote xml:id="q-515" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_Matthew_26:38">my soul was sad even to the death</quote>. Yet, in this exigent,
                 whither <quote xml:id="q-516" type="allusion" source="#_Acts_14:15">could I fly for relief but to that great God which made
                 heaven and Earth</quote>? I desired to cast myself solely at his
                 feet of mercy; yea, before the throne of the most gracious God
                 <quote xml:id="q-517" type="partial" source="#_Acts_17:28">in whom I live, and move, and have my being</quote>, saying with

                 these thoughts, it pleased him in a wondrous manner to begin to give me some comfort from sinking in my hopes, and to
                 stay myself on him when I was almost past hopes by reason
                 of my weakness. This I obtained out of that

            blessed portion of scripture which our dear saviour spake
                in <ref source="#_Matthew_11:28-30">St Matthew, the 11th chapter, and 28-30 verses</ref>
                 which, like the
                 lightning breaking into a dark place, thus it pierced
                 into the secret darkness of my sorrowful heart and dejected
                 soul; bringing refreshment and some hopes of relief and comfort
                 being increased in the consideration of those heavenly mercies
                 contained in that scripture. Looking upon this as his sweet
                and effectual call to my soul, wherein he then bid me, come
                 unto him and alone seek of him that had strength, power and mercy
                 to relieve all poor, sinful, dejected souls which laboured and 
                 were heavy laden with sins the saddest burden then to be born:
                 '<quote xml:id="q-520" type="direct" source="#KJV_Matthew_11:28">Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
                 and I will give you rest</quote>'.</p>
            <p>Behold, the handmaid of the Lord: I laboured under and was
                 <quote xml:id="q-521" type="phrase" source="#KJV_Psalms_38:4">heavy laden with the burden of my sins</quote> under the burden of
                 Satan's bondage and slavery of fears. The one bringing me towards despair, the other of torment, persuading that time was
                 past for any help from God; that the devil might wreak his ancient
                 malice against souls on me in my sickness and weakness
                 then, being the fittest opportunity to prevail when he shakes
                their faith. <quote xml:id="q-522" type="allusion" source="#_Psalms_18:6">But, lo, in this my distress</quote>, <quote xml:id="qx-522" type="partial" source="#_Revelation_5:5">the lion of the

                 to repent and believe, nor him to accept of my soul. And so,
                 by this, he vanquished his strongest stratagem by which he
                 surpriseth the poor, doubting Christian, when at the lowest ebb
                this he trieth; if by any means he can make him doubt or
                 question the rich goodness that is eternally in God as his very
                 being, and <quote xml:id="q-524" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_12:31-32 #_Mark_3:28-29 #_Luke_12:10">so commit the great sin against his mercy</quote> from
                whence flows man's salvation and then, he is lost forever.</p>
            <p>But at this time, when I was weakest, <quote xml:id="q-525" type="phrase" source="#_1John_2:1">Christ Jesus, the righteous</quote> came into my heart, <quote xml:id="q-526" type="phrase" source="#KJV_Malachi_4:2">with healing under his wings</quote>,
                 making it appear that Satan was a liar and that he never refuseth
                 any who come unto him, according to that place of <quote xml:id="q-527" type="partial" source="#KJV_John_6:37">those that
                 come unto me I will in no wise cast off</quote>. He calls, he invites,

            this word and set it home by his spirit; to stay my
                 drooping heart, even ready to faint and perish for want
                 of spiritual food. Behold, I was weary with the burden of
                 sin and he said, 'Come'. I was faint and heavy laden; he
                 said 'Come'. Lord, I come, but to whom must I come for relief?
                 <quote xml:id="q-528" type="direct" source="#KJV_Matthew_11:28">Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I

                 Satan, I see no reason why I should not come with my sadness and burdens for thou hast promised to give me rest.</p>
            <p>Alas, O Lord God, I need it and want it: I almost sink under thy heavy hand of displeasure. <quote xml:id="q-529" type="allusion" source="#_Jonah_2:1-2">I cry unto thee out

                free grace, thou, O my dear saviour, suffered the wrath of thy

                 pleased to vanquish my grand enemy by the power of thy

                 life everlasting at that present when  my heart was in doubting.

                 of his love, insomuch that all fears of dying were taken
                 away, and then I was more willing to depart when he called

                 with abundant gladness and praise, when I looked for nothing
                 but death and destruction; showing that the mercies of the eternal

            For he, appointing means, blessed the same to me, so that by 
                 degrees I was strengthened in body and in a great part recovered health; though not perfectly, for a quarter of a year being
                 brought so exceeding weak in my sickness.</p>
            <p>But, within a quarter after, I found myself with quick child

                 I should retain conception; after those violencies and extremities of vomiting, et cetera, which loosened the womb extremely.
                 But forever blessed be the most high and powerful and gracious
                goodness of our God, which rebuked the fever, giving means

                 going purposely to prevent the breaking up an execution against him from that <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> against his estate
                
                for a debt of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs>, which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had been advised by some to secure out of his own estate and to engage for it. So, until he could receive the monies from
                 <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> out of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> estate there, which was by his

                 and portions in feoffee in trusts hands,<anchor xml:id="ev142-end" type="event"/> <milestone xml:id="ev142a-start" unit="event"/>and he had been advised

                 <persName ref="ppl:mn1">my uncle, Mr Norton</persName>, by way of assignment and to pay
                 those things chargeable thereupon. But, albeit there was
                 a good estate (which was £1000 per annum)
                 there, from whence
                 these debts should arise, yet it was altogether against
                 <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs>, or my own judgement or advice, that he
                 should take upon him so great a trouble as that must be:
                 both in regard that neither his purse nor person was suiting such 
                 an enterprise, being in another nation (so a hazard to
                 his person) and likewise not suited in other respects to withstand the disputes, which she foresee would arise from some
                 that were concerned for themselves. Nor was there the least 
                necessity for him to engage in it for gaining my £1000 there,
                 by reason both that and all other rights and dues which could be
                challenged by <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> and myself, were sufficiently

            followed (as it afterwards appeared). And besides, my
                 English portion was sufficiently and undoubtedly safe and secured to him  of £1500 by the will and lease from <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle, William
                     Wandesford</persName>, out of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>, and by articles three partite

            But it so happened that he was advised — without our knowledge
                    or consent as aforesaid — to engage to <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName>, as well as
                 to the business of the assignment for a debt of £1000 payable

                 violency and fierceness that he compelled him to borrow monies
                 to satisfy his clamour, and he had paid him £900<am>l</am> and
                    above, nor would he be satisfied because the bond was for a
                 £1000 and not being taken in by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, he sued for the whole
                    and for charges,

                    and most unjustly and deceitfully, watch
                 an opportunity when <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> to have
                 dispatched it. He got an execution broke up and by his
                 own man, with four other bailiffs, came early in a morning to
                    seize upon all our goods, monies, plate, et cetera, until he were all
                 satisfied. At first, very stiffly demanded £800<am>l</am> then to
                 be paid but, at last, by <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton's</persName> endeavours
                 (he knowing the debt was paid) prevailed to give them £200<am>l</am>
                    which they would have or plate, et cetera, to that value. </p>
            <p>This accident was very afflicting to me, in regard that I hoped
                <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> being there would have prevented it, and being
                 big with child, the grief I had with the fright and the rudeness
                 of those men had nigh gone to make me miscarry, what for
                 the injustice and unhandsomeness of that concern which came so suddenly on me in that business. Yet, the providence of God had so
                 ordered that there was £100<am>l</am> of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> newly (the week before ) come in and with £57<am>l</am> of my own (part of what <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>
                 gave me) that satisfied them at present. Or else, it might
                 have proved far worse with me then in that condition which if
                 I had wanted, peradventure, they might have taken my
                 bed from under myself and children, and those quick goods
                 <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> gave for our relief.</p>

            <p>I pray God forgive all those by whose evil counsel
                 <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> was brought into those snares: when
                 he intended most good to all parties in the acceptance of
                 the assignment, and the very troubles, vexations and afflictions it carried along in the whole course of transactions
                often times brought us into straits and great danger of my
                 life, proving one sad ingredient to my other sorrows.</p>
            <p>
    
                And indeed, I did fear some hard measure to fall
                 unawares to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and partly told him my conjecture , offering to pay <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> off with those monies <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> gave
                me before he went to London. But he, good man, did not believe
                 nor could imagine that he might find such treachery in
                 those lawyers he employed.<anchor xml:id="ev144-end" type="event"/></p>
            
            <p>Yet did my suspicion prove a means in part to arm me with
                 patience to overcome that trouble when it came. Thus, have
                 I upon every occasion and act of my life, fresh cause to

                 so that, lest we should offend God by serving him in his own
                 way and command (superstitiously) and pray to him in his
                own words, there was found out another manner of

                 lost men, was had in contempt as useless to the church of

            <p>In what a condition, then, may it be thought the true church of

                be 
                
                partakers of the benefit of salvation
                 through his bloodshed. And the breach of his loving command,

            <p>After which, drawing near <date when-custom="1662-08/1662-09">within a month of my delivery</date>,
                 it behoved me to look with a more narrow search into my
                 soul and examine how my thoughts and desires were inclined
                to accept of death, whose time of life here very probably
                 might be short: this was <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my seventh child</rs> which the Lord had given
                 me to conceive. (I had more strong apprehensions of my
                 change in regard it was both <rs ref="ppl:edg1" type="person">my husband's mother's</rs> number and my own.) This did more lively persuade that, as death waited at all times, yet more reason for us to expect
                 it at these strange and miraculous times of childbearing,
                especially as they have been to me — more than many others —
                 motives of examination of my estate and condition spiritual (of the growth or decay of Christian graces which God
                 had wrought in me by reason of my several trials and sorrows came on me in the whole course of my life, and whether
                 I had returned due thanks to God for the same and removal
                 of his hand of afflictions in my deliverances).</p>
            <p>Upon which, I found that for the want of these holy ordinances,
                 and that by sad experience, that these troubles of the world 
                had interrupted or diverted my free communion and close
                 walking with God; as he had required of us not to be taken
                 of from his service and precepts for any worldly enjoyment
                 whatever, nor crosses should be my hindrance. But alas,
                 such was my weakness that I had broken those solemn vows
                 of baptismal and sacramental too frequently, through
                 <quote source="#BCP,_The_Litany" xml:id="q-557" type="allusion">negligence, ignorance</quote>, wilful sins and worldly employments.
                 So that I had impulses upon my heart and great desires to renew this grand strengthening and quickening and confirming
                 ordinance of our dear saviour: <quote xml:id="q-558" type="allusion" source="#_1Corinthians_7:10">desiring in all true and unfeigned repetance</quote>, <quote xml:id="q-559" type="phrase" source="#_1Corinthians_13:13">faith, hope and charity</quote> to be made

                 in the worst for the disadvantage of my poor children, having then but <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="person">two daughters</rs> living. Also, I found that the

            Upon the serious consideration of these things, I was in

            <p>Albeit there wanted not some who, guided by self-interest, repined at anything which tended to the support
                 of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and his children, especially by me because I was
                not of their faction as I was told. Although I may, and do, appeal to
                 themselves whether I have not laid out myself and
                 fortune to secure all peoples' just rights from us if it were 
                 never so prejudicial to my own interest. And so may
                 hope for a blessing according to my good conscience and integrity, who having given to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> and friends' use and for
                 his debts, which I could no way be capable of  contracting
                 from my own children that which should be for their provision;
                 so that, had I not endeavoured some satisfaction for those
                 whom God had given me, I had been unworthy to have
                 borne the name of a mother, leaving them in such an unsettled estate and sad condition. Yea, even altogether unprovided for in this world , showing myself one of St Paul's
                 infidels: <quote xml:id="q-573" type="paraphrase" source="#_1Timothy_5:8">He that provideth not for them of his own house
                 hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel</quote>.</p>
            <p>So, then let not others' uncharitable displeasure blame
                 what was done in this kind; since <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> was
                 pleased to show his love and affection to his faithful wife
                 and children (in answer to the noble fortune, as he called it,
                 that he had with me) whose trouble only was that his burdens
                 was so great that he was compelled to lessen his estate in
                 part to free the rest. Nor could he leave more for his younger children's maintenance and education and portions than 
                 <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, which was about £100<am>l</am> per annum. And this did 
                 not satisfy those peoples' humours, as I was told
                 by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, because it was not charged
                 with debts first to precede my children's provision.
                 Albeit we had by mutual consent set over a debt
                 from <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>, out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> for seven years of
                 £200<am>l</am> per annum, which was by agreement to satisfy for
                my £1000 portion and the debt which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> had paid
                to <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName>. Also, the £1000 which was left of the sale of

            <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> was laid out in a rentcharge out of <persName ref="ppl:ls1">Mr
                 Laurence Sayer's</persName> land of £80<am>l</am> per annum. This was deputed for the debts: all which did amount to the sum of £3000
                 nor did the debts of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> amount to that sum by
                 £600<am>l</am>. Nevertheless, by the sequel of all, it did appear that
                 this just and honest action of ours did exasperate such
                 without a cause, who had desires that <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> (so well as
                 the rest of all his personal estate) should go for security
                 collateral to the rest. And by that means, nothing should
                 be left at certain for my poor younger children.</p>
            <p>The case seemed very hard to me and made me endeavour 
                 the more earnestly to prosecute this settlement, which yet I
                obtained with a grand difficulty by reason of these obstacles. But, at last, prevailed to have it done without the said
                 contingency; nor did I intend to alter the same without
                 great cause, which I hoped in God would not be because there
                 was so great a sum left for his debts, and was made believe it could not be cut off the entail without my consent
                 (but it proved afterward the contrary to my great grief
                 and almost my utter ruin and my children's).</p>
            <p>There was left only <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, which was my jointure, settled
                 so on my heir that it could not be cut off without my consent
                 in passing a fine, nor was the rents ever more clear then
                 seven score paid a year of it.<anchor xml:id="ev147b-end" type="event"/></p>
            
            <p>And now, I heartily thank my gracious God, who gave me
                 opportunity to get this done for the satisfaction of my
                 conscience and the relief of my children. Blessed be his name
                 that did not take me out of this life before, lest by some
                 means they might have been disappointed. And I leave

                 disposition of the great God, humbly craving his blessing

            <p>Which duties, I made it my study to observe, and though I

                 to my utmost capacity with a good conscience towards all.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as the future wellbeing of my children did
                then represent itself to my thoughts — and it had pleased God
                 in mercy to spare me until that time living to see myself

             I was the more induced upon this account to accept of a 
                 proposition formerly made and begun in the year <date when-custom="1665">1665</date>, by
                 <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, that he would except of
                himself for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice Thornton</persName>, in marriage.
            

            <pb xml:id="page-217"/>



            
                 
            
                Who, though her years were but young, being 14 then,
                yet such was his great affection towards her that he was
                desirous to attend for her seven years if he might by his leave
                obtain her at last (having deserted all other opportunities
                for her sake and the favours <persName ref="ppl:tc1">he</persName> had from <persName ref="ppl:tc1">him</persName>). And, also, that whatever her fortune was , it should be wholly for her to use and hers
                 withal: he did not despair but that God, who had preserved
                 him hitherto, would provide a handsome competency and to make
                 a better provision for <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> by adding to her own.
                 This proposition was answered by a fair respect of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
                side and he was encouraged to proceed.</p>
            <p>Nor could I be satisfied in a business of this nature, on which
                might depend the wellbeing of our family, without  serious and
                 deep consideration of all our affairs and the condition that our estate
                 was in. Which, being well known to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my good brother Denton</persName>
                 more than to any in the world, I consulted and advised with
                 him all along in this transaction.</p>
            <p>Whose prudence and discretion was a great support to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
                and myself in all our business and actions. He, also having had
                 knowledge and acquaintance of <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this gentleman</rs> for several years,
                 might the better judge of his life and conversation, together with his
                 qualifications for the great and high calling of the ministry;</p>
            <p> which, in itself considered, carries along with it the most noble
                 title that man is capable of in this world and wherein the highest
                acts of piety and religion is vested: being honoured by God 
                 himself in the old and new testament above all other dignities,
                 and having the greatest opportunity of drawing near to the <quote xml:id="q-647" type="phrase" source="#_Hebrews_4:16">throne
                     of grace</quote> from whence proceeds <quote xml:id="qx-653" type="partial" source="#KJV_James_1:17">every good and perfect gift</quote>,
                 showing to us mortals the way to everlasting life.</p>
            <p>After the consideration of all these motives as principally to be
                 regarded, I was in the next place confirmed in our resolves to
                 proceed in this business for <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>, whom I hoped to
                 be placed near us and her friends at <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName>, being our own
                church, where I might have better advantage for <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son,
                    Robert</persName>, and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="person">his sisters'</rs> instruction.</p>
            <p>Also, I perceived by this last unsettling of that estate from
                 <rs type="group" ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1">my daughters and younger children</rs>, they were brought into an
                 uncertainty for their provision, which might fall too heavily
                 out for them and be the worse for them after my decease.</p>

            <pb xml:id="page-218"/>



            
                
            
            <p>So that, upon consideration of the whole business I have
                 mentioned, it was conceived convenient to entertain
                 this motion and to close with such a happy opportunity which
                 by the providence of God was directed. And by reason of
                 her youth, we resolved to keep it secret until a fitter time
                 when this intended business should be consummated.
                 There being still an affectionate correspondency of these
                 persons by chaste and religious conversations in our family.

                 Neither was I out of hopes that <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>
                might duly pay his £2000 out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, which was to
                 redeem that estate and pay <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> engagements.</p>
            <p>But, in the meantime, I might more probably die in some

                 with violent fits of the stone. Having had several of them

                 that he was very weak in body, though I bless God perfect

                 sad and afflicting hand of God by reason of the want of the
                 use of his understanding, which came to him by a deep
                 melancholy seizing upon his spirit (partly for the loss of
                  my said brother and the grief he took upon ill usage

            After the recovery of my health and strength again,
                 I had returned another affliction which was not at that
                 time so heavy (when I was sick myself, I bless God)
                 but, like two buckets in a well it pleased God to deal with
                 us: when the one was down the other was up. So, I being
                 recruited, had my work in the assistance of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, whose often and frequent relapses into his palsy
                 fell on him to my abundant grief; so that, <date when-custom="1667-11/1668-08">from November 1667 
                 until August 1668</date>, <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName> was almost each month

                him. Which most sad condition made me never enjoyed myself with fears of losing him, my chiefest comfort and
                 support, and for his sufferings. Although the Lord did please
                 to give him intermissions, and also we could not perceive that 
                 he was in any extremity but slumbering all the time of
                 his illness, until after clysters he was brought

            to himself again (they being the speediest remedy at

               direction and he was well again even to peoples' 
                 admiration, which was so ill of a sudden and better again.
               And, according to the earliness of beginning with remedies,
                 they wrought and the fits longer or shorter in continuance<anchor xml:id="ev202-end" type="event"/>;

                 so that we saw, too apparently, that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> distemper might be a means to shorten his days at last. And 
                 we were much concerned to get all the settlements 
               done and perfected, lest we should be deprived of him.</p>
            <p>And to that end, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
                 and myself, was exceedingly employed at all times,
                 almost when he was in a condition for business:
                 hastening the drafts of writings and settlements with
                 counsel how to give all persons satisfaction in their
                just debts. And not until the <date when-custom="1668-05-28">28th day of May 1668</date>
                 was our settlement perfected (from the time of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin
                 Covill's</persName> being destroyed) for either portions or maintenance , which went most sadly with me. But now, by the great
                 pains and industry of <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>,
                who we did for my children's good employ  as a

                for them. Also, it was most true that I lived remote from my
                own relations.  That day wherein <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
                 signed his deed for my children's provision out of 
                 <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, he did sign <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton's</persName> three rentcharge

            About the <date when-custom="1668-05-20">20th day of May,</date> on that night, my dear husband had a dream which he told to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>,
                 <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> and myself, in the morning severally, which

                 live but 47 days longer.<anchor xml:id="ev204-end" type="event"/> Nor was he ever apt to
                 take notice of such things, but rather condemn me
                 for relating several ominous dreams that I had before
                 the death of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs>, <persName ref="ppl:eo1">my uncle Osborne</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:kwd1">my sister

                 make use of this as a warning to him, being often
                 heard to say he should not live very long, and with much
                 diligence endeavoured to prepare his soul for God.
                 In which time, I, who had my comforts so entirely bound up in him , could not with patience almost to think
                 of this change, if possibly it might be the good pleasure

               We repaired, upon the next illness, to <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName> (he not
                 being willing for any others advice), to confided what
                 course could be taken for his preservation; so that, upon
               a serious consideration of his distemper then inclining
                to melancholic, he advised him for <rs ref="place:Scar_046" type="place">the spa</rs>, where he
                 had been other years with good success. Upon which, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>

            <p>All which time, we had a dear and comfortable correspondency

                 It cannot be imagined what my joy was in his return

                 of spirit but I quickly saw that his weakness had left

                 upon <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">my niece</rs> her account, but that she should now come
                 to fetch her from me, whose welfare I much wished and
                 loved her company, without giving me any notice, I could
                 not tell what to say of it. And that what my poor house could

            for her should not be a wanting, no more than what
                 I had formerly done to my weak capacity. And I could

               her of <rs ref="ppl:cd4" type="person">her husband's</rs> side, but I, that looked at her or showed any
                 respect. I said that I could not so well know the reason,
                 save that she brought no fortune and was a charge to that family,
                 as I had heard them say, and that <persName ref="ppl:td3">Sir Thomas Danby</persName> could not be
                 reconciled because of <persName ref="ppl:cd4">Kit's</persName> marriage to her against his

                 to him, that was extremely sharp: where he told her that

                and their marriage was not lawful, and for her (that had not
                 a groat portion after such an act) to be so proud and high
                 as to require him to furnish her with silk stockings, satin
                 and cloth,  silver mantles and other things answerable to that
                 state, was more presumption than any could imagine
                (<rs ref="ppl:cd4" type="person">his son</rs> being a younger brother, and so had nothing but from
                 his goodness). <persName ref="ppl:td3">Sir Thomas Danby</persName> expressing much more to her in

                seldom
                
                see her in all his life, but shunned her at all times,
               sending for <rs ref="ppl:cd4" type="person">his son</rs> into <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> without her. I said, I had
                 not heard of such letters, but that<persName ref="ppl:td3"> Sir Thomas</persName> was much displeased

            time of her entrance into his family for the mischief she
                 had wrought in it, and that match could not prosper which was
                 begun in such an unlawful manner; it had been the grand
                 discontent of his life and more to the like purpose several
                 times, so, <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> nor myself, after many endeavours,
                 could never prevail for her. Yet did I always commiserate her condition, whose person was so qualified and 
                 seemed to be religious and carried so fair in her demeanour,
                 having abundance of charity for her condition, having
                 helped her with advice and assistance in all things to my
                 power, believing that she had been wronged according to her
                 own complaint.<anchor xml:id="ev206a-end" type="event"/>

                When our discourse was ended, they 
                 came from <placeName ref="place:Ston_054">church</placeName> and went to dinner. After, it was consulted
                 on and thought fit to send to <persName ref="ppl:gf1">Mr Farrer</persName>, at <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName>, for his
                 advice whether <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> might go to <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName> as a visit.
                 Who returned by word that he conceived she might go 
                
                
                thither,
                
                 although he knew that place was in opposition to <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam Danby</persName>
                 and would displease her if she stayed any time, but for a while
                 she might go, as he thought, without prejudice. This she 
               conceived was allowance, but he spoke very prudently 
                 to both parties. Then, <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> was pleased (as it were)
                 to consult, as she said (at least in pretence) with me of her 
                 going thither. Which I could not tell how to determine because,
                at that time, <persName ref="ppl:med1">her sister Danby</persName> was coming into the <placeName ref="place:Ryed_129">country</placeName> and
                 I was to use my endeavours for her, having then very
               good hopes, as also, so had <persName ref="ppl:gf1">Mr Farrer</persName>, who said he did
                 believe he could prevail for £60<am>l</am> a year if she would except
                 it. And withal, I did not know what to advise which might
               satisfy her but left it to her how to dispose herself; for
                I told her that, as well as I could entertain her in <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">my house</rs>,
                 she should want for nothing. I would use my utmost with
                 <rs ref="ppl:med1" type="person">her sister</rs> to give a sufficient provision for her and her children
                 but doubted that her journey to <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName> might do harm.
               But because I could not do her what good I would, being so
                 low in our estate, I could not hinder from her better advantage. She said, indeed, it was much below her to go to
                service as <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName> did counsel her, and she thanked God,</p>

            <p>if she would take that course of life, she could do better
                 for herself. But she would go over to see the place because
                 it was out of <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mattie Batt's</persName> love, extolling her friendship
                 to the skies and much undervaluing all my endeavours and
                 faithfulness; yet, did she expect this as a reserve if
                 she liked not <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName>. <date when-custom="1668-07-20">The next morning</date> prepared with great
                 joy to go and, when she was at breakfast, expressed much
                 indignation that she was turned out (as she termed it) for my
                sake from <placeName ref="place:Beda_002">Bedale</placeName>. I could answer no otherwise than to
                show my sorrow for it, and that if she had informed me of that
                 before that <rs ref="ppl:med1" type="person">her sister</rs> was angry, she should not have come.</p>
            <p>At her going that morning, she was highly displeased (as
                 I was informed that she spoke it to) that <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> or <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my 
                 brother Denton</persName>, who she had much deluded with fair show,
                 did not wait upon her to <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName>, and was only conducted by <rs type="person">my chief servant</rs> and three of <persName ref="ppl:js2">the Earl's</persName> men, with <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs

            This was only a pretence, though pride enough; for when
                 I sent men and horses to bring her home — above 60 miles
                hence on purpose — she was not pleased because <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
                 came not. But sent them back empty, save with a letter to
                 <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> to invite him (under pretence) but really the other, who she then prosecuted, with eager design,
                 for to draw him in for a husband for <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName>. And in
                 whose encomium, she had spent so much time and pains
                to represent him with the best of rhetoric to her, which at the
                 first view, was sufficiently forward to show her good opinion of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">that man</persName>. <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was highly displeased
                 that she had been so uncivil to return his servant empty, and
                 that also he was made so welcome there that he differed not from
                 a beast in his drunkenness at that house; so that he would not
                let me send no more for her.<anchor xml:id="ev206c-end" type="event"/></p>

            In this time, I was so far from giving her any abuse
                 or remembering these injuries that, <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam Danby</persName> coming to see
                me on <date when-custom="1668-05-01">May Day</date>, I so much solicited for her that she did
                 faithfully engage to me that for my sake, and not her own which
                 had personally disobliged her at <placeName ref="place:Beda_002">Bedale</placeName>
            

            <pb xml:id="page-239"/>



            
                 
            
            before she came to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>. Yet, she would do what she
                 could and that she would give her £60<am>l</am> per annum and give her £10<am>l</am>
                 or £5<am>l</am> when she came to see her at a time, and give her all her goods again,
                and if she could do more, she would as she was able, et cetera.
                 And did protest and vow that she did not take it ill that
                <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">her sister</rs> came to me, but wished her to come and that it was
                 but her plot to object that to me, to insinuate with me and to 
                 make me keep her; for she knew not that she was with me when
                she discharged her house, but that her own insufferable pride,
                 which would never be humbled, and <rs type="person" ref="ppl:bt1">her railing black-mouthed
                 wench</rs> that came to <placeName ref="place:Farn_135">Farnley</placeName> and abused her there, these all
                 did cause her to cast her out, and much to this purpose.</p>
            <p>And that she was going to look into her estate, being the first
                time after <rs ref="ppl:td4" type="person">her husband's</rs> death, and as she found she could do for
                 her she would, though she did it out of her own estate for
                 my cause to bring them together although they wanted for
                 nothing now. Upon these terms passed <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam Danby</persName> and myself, concluding that I was to wait on her at <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName> at her 
                 return when she would satisfy me better and do for her. </p>
            <p>Having received this handsome and free account from <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam
                 Danby</persName>, I deferred not to give <persName ref="ppl:cd4">Kit's</persName> <rs type="person" ref="ppl:acd1">wife</rs> the relation of it
                 by letter to <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName>, purposely sending one before our last men
                 went for her. And her return for this kindness, I have

            But afterwards, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> (going to see his friends
                 near <placeName ref="place:Leed_033">Leeds</placeName>) brought her back again to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, where I did
                 receive her with joy as was my custom out of my unfeigned
                 love to her person, nor could I be persuaded of her unworthiness to me. She so finely acting her part and so secretly, only I
                 observed abundance of height and majesty in her deportment,
                 with a kind of scorn, at her return rather more than usual
                 towards me. And did see that then I was made use of as upon
                necessity, not affection as was formerly much pretended.</p>
            <p>My endeavours was much slighted and daintily overseen,
                 and she highly incensed that she had not been waited upon by
                 <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, which she looked upon it as if he slighted her
                favour and rejected <rs ref="ppl:mb2" type="person">her friend</rs> by not accepting that motion,<anchor xml:id="ev206e-end" type="event"/></p>

            <p>which unpardonable offence could not be passed without 
                 great indignation. Yet, so secret and subtle was this acted

            Let this practice of hers be examined: whether she carried
                 herself to me, either as a Christian, a friend or a well-wisher,
                 who publicly
                made me believe — nay, recommended — this
                 match to me as (in her own judgement and choice) we would
                 be exceeding happy in it; for she did find <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> to be a
                 man of as great piety and parts incomparable as she never
                 knew in all her life, and that she had solicited for him, advising
                 both parties (that is to say <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>) to this
                business, above three years ago. She knew also their affections  and the progress of all that concern, and with a full gale of
                 consent, she went along with it as well, with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>
                 as ourselves.<anchor xml:id="evn8-end" type="event"/> <milestone xml:id="ev207-start" unit="event"/>All
                 which proves it an undoubted act of displeasure conceived
          against me and an act of revenge; thus, seeking to withdraw
                 this man's intentions from the long-intended match and that really
                 she had excellent, good opinions of this gentleman to draw
                 him to <rs ref="ppl:mb2" type="person">her bosom friend</rs>, whom she so loved and would prefer.
                 And I know not how it can be distinguished from a treacherous and unworthy part in a friend thus to deal with me,
                 after so long and serious debate of his intended marriage
                 with <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>, with her own counsel, advice and approbation.
                 And so falsely to undermine the same for her own partial
                 and secret designs: first, to have offered herself to bring a 
                 match about with <persName ref="ppl:kf1">Mrs Katherine Farrer</persName> (which she told him
                 would be of great advantage to him) and then, when that failed

                and our resolutions already long since agreed upon —</p>
            <p> but this did not satisfy her, until she had made a new trial

                related of <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName>. In all which time, since her last coming to

                 excellent plausibility <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> affections from <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>,
                 after her evil designs was hatched against us at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>.
                 These are full proof of her great admiration of <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this man</rs> 
                 with 100 more tricks: telling him that she had so great an 
                 honour for him that he deserved a better fortune and wife than
                 she was, for there was like to be nothing worthy of his
                parts and deservings, and that he would be undone and never live
                 comfortable life. And she wished him so well that she could
                 desire him the best wife in the world, ever admiring his perfections
                 and insinuated so much that she got his sermon notes or heads,
                 and then write them over and called them her own (so did she with
                him about his coats of heraldry of the nobility of England),</p>
            <p> ever seeking opportunities when to use artifices to her own
                 purpose of insinuation, which can be testified for truth to
                 ingratiate into his affection, none endeavouring to admire
                 his person and all expressions imaginable than herself. </p>
            <p>At the same time, though at secret opportunities, she would
                 come to <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, telling her that she wished her
                 so well, and loved her for her good nature and virtue, that she
                 would have her marry the best husband in the world and that she
                 deserved it. And that, if those things were true that <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> was
                 charged with, he was not worthy to live and God forbid she should
                have him, with abundance of such insinuations to this purpose.
                 <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Nally</persName> told her, she thanked her for her love, but she was

                 and that she had never known any unhandsomeness from him
                in all her life. It was true she had an affection for him, for
                she see no other cause, for she had received much good
                 from him for her soul, and she would have done well to have
                showed her dislike before. And to that purpose, thanking her for
                 propounding one of her own relations to her; for she was 
                not worthy of such a person of honour; and that she hoped to God

            he would direct her in her choice, when she did marry,
                 that she might lead a comfortable life in the fear of God
                though not so high in the world, et cetera. And she could

                 civil to me but so highly incensed against <persName ref="ppl:cd4">Kit's</persName> <rs type="person" ref="ppl:acd1">wife</rs> as
                 I did admire. And, at first, would not scarce hear me
                 speak for her at all: saying that since she saw me last,
                 she had been informed of her perfidious railing and dishonour
                 in all things, making her guilty as much as her lying
                 tongue and godly railing could do of the horriblest sins of the
                 world, and she would do nothing because of her wicked malice.</p>
            <p>And that, for all what I did for her, she was unworthy of it
                 because she had railed on me too for a requital.
                 But, I said, I could not believe any such thing of her who
                had so much religion, et cetera, and I thought her wronged,
                begging that she would not believe anythingany thing against her
                 from evil instruments that sowed discord betwixt them.
                 And at the last, with much ado, endeavoured to
                 prevail that she would, for my
                 sake, give them a sufficient provision and settle £80<am>l</am> per annum
                 on her and her children. She said that, if she would except
                 £60<am>l</am> a year, which was all that she could do, they should
            

            <pb xml:id="page-243"/>



            
                 
            
            have it done; and that she would get <persName ref="ppl:cd4">Kit</persName> a place in a troop
                 and give them their furniture and fit him with accoutrements 
                 of all things for it; and, if she see them endeavour to live,
                 she would give her £10<am>l</am> or £5<am>l</am> at a time for encouragement
                 when she came to see her. But I, having no commission
                 to accept of £60<am>l</am> per annum from <persName>my niece Danby</persName> but a charge
                 to the contrary, could not promise for her; only pressed for
                 £80<am>l</am>, leaving her to consider of it because £60<am>l</am> would not
                 pay their debts, and I would acquaint <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> with
                 her proposals and would give her an account.</p> 
            <p>To that end
                 I did, at my return to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, give her as favourable an
                 account of my embassy as I could, concealing
                 all speeches which should give her the least cause of trouble.</p>
            <p>But <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> was not inclinable to accept of <rs ref="ppl:med1" type="person">her sister's</rs>
                 offers, but stood upon her high horse. She would either
                 have £80<am>l</am> a year settled upon her and her debts promised
                 to be paid, or she would never enslave herself again to live 
                as she had done with her children. She could tell how to live
                 otherwise, if she might not live handsomely with them.</p>
            <p>After a day's time or two, it was thought fit I should 
                 write to <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam Danby</persName> again to second my solicitation for
                 her. And a letter was contrived by consent, wherein I writ
                 with as much humble submission as a petitioner for another
                 could dictate, only some clauses was put in from <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs
                 Danby's</persName> own mouth (wherein she said she could not subsist
                under £80<am>l</am> a year, and if it were until seven years and their debts
                 paid).  <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam Danby</persName> returned me a most sharp and bitter
                 answer: that since I was so positive for <persName ref="ppl:cd4">Kit's</persName> <rs type="person" ref="ppl:acd1">wife</rs>, and that she
                 would not except of her free offers by me, which she was not
                 obliged to otherwise than by her good will, she would never
                 give her anything at all; and that she had made her brags
                 she had better friends than <rs ref="ppl:cd4" type="person">her husband's</rs> and could provide
                 for herself, she might; and that she would take care of <rs type="person" ref="ppl:cd4">her husband </rs> and the children she had, to bring them up and provide
            

            <pb xml:id="page-244"/>



            
                 
            
            for them and him, but would never have anything to
                do for her, with several such like expressions, so much
                 was she disobliged for her high demands. And upon this
                 account did she cast her off, nor would have nothing
                to do with her further, and was so much displeased at
                 me that I, then, quite lost her favour. Neither could I see
                 any requital in the other but a slighting for my faithfulness and goodwill. Yet still, I shall not fail of my
                duty of charity to pray for those in necessity and forgiveness that hates me without a cause. <anchor xml:id="ev207a-end" type="event"/></p>

                 showed to her as my bosom friend — in whose friendship
                 I rejoiced and thought myself happy in being instrumental to do any thing serviceable to her in faithfulness and
                 affection, as well in testimonies of gratitude for what
                kindness I received in my former sicknesses and two children —

                 there was nothing awanting in my family or myself
                 which she might not freely command (witnessed by all people
                 that knew my actions and would speak nothing but truth)
                 nor anything displeased her but I took it done to myself.
                 Yet, had I never, until now, cause to bewail my sad fortune

            to be their bitterest adversaries and repine at their
                 happiness, when themselves are miserable or unfortunate.
                 Some of <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">this gentlewoman's</rs>
                    
                 sinister endeavours has been declared
                 by me, with their proof being very evident: endeavouring to have
                 gotten subsistence more to her satisfaction under their
                 roofs, when she should have brought that match to perfection,
                being that which was conjectured by her eager designs.
                 Having wholly cast off those former friendships which she
                 pretended for me, I need not examine the injustice or wrong
                 done in this action, but should have waived anything (as
                 I did of this nature) had it rested there and not proceeded to
                 such high indignities against my person and the family
                from whence I descended: persons of honour, virtue and worth,
                 whose ashes long since was buried in the unspotted bed of
                honour, and therefore could be nothing else but of the <quote xml:id="q-680" type="phrase" source="#_Revelation_12:9 #_Revelation_20:2">old

            amongst them. Nor can it be imaginable that one whose
                 heart God had framed so tender, even as I may say

                 of afflictions and trials; being fearful of the least sin,

                 endanger the soul of all people under my care or

                 God, or prone of itself to do anything unseemly, the
                 laws of morality or divinity is very strange. Nay, I must with all humility acknowledge the gift and grace from God, and with
                 an unfeigned gratitude to his majesty, who hath made
                 me even from my youth to abhor not only the acts of 
                 these natures but all inclinations, tendencies, or compliances which might defile the body or pollute that precious soul
                 redeemed at so dear a rate, as by the blood of the eternal

                 and endeavours to aim at that perfection which is commanded

                 I may possibly obtain that for which I am apprehended of Christ
                 Jesus, although I daily cast myself down at the footstool (in the true sense of my own unworthiness) of Christ

                my honour, untouched in its root and branches, as mine was
                 to relieve herself under my roof by all imaginable

                 and abuses to him, who had been a daily witness of my
                 carriage for many years together. And those many things, which
                 I was charged with as crimes, he himself had been made known

                 people envied me, either a being in this world or the grace

            Neither could I be informed of such slanders against
                 me until by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">maid's</rs> taking an occasion to fall
             out with me about the dressing the chamber, when it was very
                 foul. She, being in <rs ref="ppl:mb1" type="person">that woman's</rs> place (which they pretended
                 had first raised those lies) and desiring to have been in <rs ref="ppl:ha1" type="person">my
                 own maid's</rs> place, sought an occasion to undermine her
                 of that place or else to give me warning to provide for one
                 in hers, having a desire to be at liberty (which I was not unwilling to in regard of myself but because I kept her with
                 me until <persName>my niece Danby</persName> was resettled in her own house, and
             then she was to go with her and to have done <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> a
                 kindness in it). But, on the contrary, it proved an unfortunate act by reason of their disgusts both of <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">the mistress</rs> and
                 <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">servant</rs> against myself and family. Yet, it was the occasion that brought these mysteries of forgeries to my knowledge:
                 <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">the maid</rs> telling me that she could tell me who had abused
                 and wronged me in my family, but not unless she went away for making a mischief, as she called it.</p>
            <p>Upon which words, I told her that I should have been beholden to 
                her if she knew I was wronged and to let me know by whom. 
                But she said, no, not unless she went away. I said, it was 
                 very hard if I could not be informed of the injury was done without
                 she went away and I would be determined by <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">her mistress</rs>.
                So, finding her mistress in the same humour — having agreed together that I should not be righted by them unless she went away  — it troubled me much to see such dealing. As also that I
                was abused, as was pretended by others, when as she, which
                 was my friend,  had concealed the matter to make her
                 own advantage against me. Nor should I have been told
                anything to have righted myself at all, if her maid's
                 quarrelling unjustly had not produced this effect.</p>
            <p>What was the cause of these proceedings, God knows; for I
                 had not given either of them just occasion, whom I had treated
                 like sisters in my house. But it was discernible that some
                 sinister end was at the bottom, and <quote xml:id="q-702" type="allusion" source="#_Ephesians_4:14-15">not out of love to the truth</quote>
                 or me that things was thus ordered.</p>

            <p>When I perceived myself thus used — rather than I
                 could endure to lie under wrongs and of what nature I
                knew not, nor how to come to understand them — I told them
                 that <persName ref="ppl:bt1">Barbara</persName> might do as she pleased. If she did not like
                 my service, she was free to please herself, though I could
                 been glad she would stay while <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">her mistress</rs> stayed. Upon this
                she was resolved to go away, but I earnestly desired
                 <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">her mistress</rs> would give her leave to tell me how I was abused , and by whom, that I might not still continue so. And I
                 should have been obliged to her if she would have told me
                 of it herself upon the account of friendship.</p>
            <p>But <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> carried so infinitely high and strangely,
                 because <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">her maid</rs> was to go from her that I got nothing
                 but scorns upon my entreaties which much amazed me.
                 Although she gave me positive warning to provide, telling
                 me she would not stay any longer. To what height then was
                 these persons come? Who did not stick to affirm I turned
                her off and not she me, which I have witness of, but to lay it on me.
                 <date when-custom="1668-07-20">Monday, the 20th of July</date>, was the day appointed, upon my
                 entreaty, to be informed by them of my wrongs; which indeed
                 had near have been my last in this life, falling out of
                 my perfect health into a very dangerous sickness on
                 the occasion of sudden and violent grief and terror, which
                 I was seized upon in <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> chamber at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>
                 being most strangely surprised at <persName ref="ppl:bt1">Barbara's</persName> accusation,
                 before my face, of my servant <persName ref="ppl:ha1">Hannah Ableson</persName> for telling
                 her several stories from <rs ref="ppl:mb1" type="person">another servant</rs> (very great
                 lies and falsehoods against myself) of such a nature as
                 I did abhor. And much unbecoming any to hear and not to
                 have acquainted me with at first, that I might have brought
                 that person to condign punishment (as <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would
                 have done if it had been from her it was laid on). But it
                 was doubted to be of new invention to have outed <persName ref="ppl:ha1">this
                 maid</persName> of my favour who, when she heard those horrid 
                 things, did utterly deny them all and cleared herself on

                 of my own conscience to bear me witness of mine and

                 desire that I would not believe any ill of them; for they

            <p>But let all be rightly determined: whether it was not
                 of pure revenge, after the march to <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName> and her losing
                her expectations of <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this man</rs>, that should harbour so
                 damnable a plot against our innocent lives in this way
                 to be even with him and me (whom because he could not be
                 withdrawn from <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> in marriage, and which she knew
                 was then in agitation as well as <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>) thus to
                requite us both and with one sling to kill two birds:
                 by that to make the world believe what a bad person I was
                 to marry <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> to such an one if it had been true.
                 And yet surely, for all her side blows in the fomenting of
                 those lies purposely to mischief me, yet she confessed she
                 had heard them long before she went to <placeName ref="place:Howl_025">Howley</placeName>. Then could
                she not possibly believe them because she had such strong

                 and wrongs were grounded upon some other grounds than
                 truth. And will, I hope, at last produce a better effect

                 children to their graves before I would do it to any man
                 and was given to vicious humours. And chose this man in confidence of being free from such.

               And now I am to take notice of the grand mercies of my

                 of those that rose up against me, but after an immeasurable 
                portion of sorrow and grief (having kept my bed 14 days, weak
                 and feeble through the exceeding pains of the mother and spleen
                 and other sicknesses thereon) yet at length he raised me 
                 up again, giving me a great comfort in my dear <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt

                weakness, came to put a stop to my troubles.

                The Lord God,
                 seeing my intentions cordially good, would not suffer me
                 to fall but gave me relief in his providence, and by the satisfaction received in my good friends had an opportunity
                to give a full account of my innocency. Yet, they did
                not question nor believe any of those slanders but, when
                 they perceived how I had been used, was very much troubled
                 for my sufferings, endeavouring to comfort my spirit so 
                 disconsolate. I will, therefore, humbly acknowledge the 
                 goodness and assistance of God in my supports of my good 
                 friends when I was in deep distress through the mischievousness of a <quote xml:id="q-712" type="phrase" source="#KJV_Psalms_120:3">false tongue</quote>. Many innocent has lost their lives

                 without the least provocation or desert; then, to have <persName ref="ppl:acd1">my

                 and that even then, when all was hatched against me, with what
                 sorrow and affliction I lived in (upon the griefs for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
                 husband's</rs> weakness and the troubles of his estate). God knows,

            how to preserve my life, which was brought into a second hazard

                 to make her guilty of those lies and abominable slanders that

                 she told her that she did not deserve what I had done for her in
                all things which she had heard from herself. And although she, herself, did witness me to be wronged, it was a sign she would

                 she should prepare herself to go from hence, and that I would
                 procure her a coach if she pleased to go any whither amongst
                her friends. Upon which, she said, I promised to keep her, and she
                 would not go out of this house. But <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs> told her, if
                 I did so, the more unworthy wretch was she that had so abused
                 me, and to this purpose, the innocentest and faithful friend she had.
                 At length, <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my good aunt</rs> so ordered the business that she named
                 a day for her going, and there was a coach procured from <persName ref="ppl:sg1">Madam

                 the earth, he fell down into the lane near a great stone
                 which, if he had light on, might have killed him (falling so
                 high, so that the danger was very great). And his deliverance also,
                 and ought to be had in remembrance with gratitude and
                 hearty thanks to the God of heaven, which sent his angel to

                 him a competent share of understanding, wit, memory,
                 a loving and affable nature, with several other good gifts
                 tending to the accomplishment of his person with natural endowments. But I do adore the Lord's name and mercy which

                 appearing in his being affected with good instructions in the
                 knowledge and fear of God, and his desire to be informed of all
                things concerning God, with notions of fear in hearing his
                judgements, with several pathetical expressions of God and
                 his ways. One day, being about four years old, he told me
                 of his own accord that God was a pure, holy, wise
                 and merciful spirit, but the devil was a wicked, lying,
                 malicious spirit: was it not better to believe this holy,
                 good God and serve him than that wicked, evil spirit which
                 would destroy us? I must, therefore, with humble gratitude
                 take notice with comfort in his mercy, which did not despise the
                 prayers of his handmaid but given me a gracious answer

                 September</date> (they going away upon <date when-custom="1668-09-11">the 11th</date>) I got up, beginning to
                 rejoice at my deliverance (from the late weakness and illness both of the plague of slanderous tongues) and the
                 faintings abated something after <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne Lightfoot</persName>
                 came to see me.<anchor xml:id="ev210-end" type="event"/></p>

    <milestone xml:id="ev210a-start" unit="event"/>
                       
                But on that day, when first I arose out of bed, I had the
                 sad news of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear and tenderly loving husband's</rs>
                 falling sick at <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName> brought to me in a letter to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my
                 brother Denton</persName>. Which so suddenly surprised my spirit,
                 yet exceeding weak, that I fell to a great trembling
                 with excessive grief and fears upon me for his life and
                 safety. So that I went sick thereupon to my sorrowful bed;
                 immediately sending for <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName> to come to him, each
                 day and night posting thither to let me know how he did.</p>
            <p>Nor could I possibly, without the loss of my life, be carried
                 to see him, albeit they could not keep me from him until I
                 was brought so feeble by reason of another accident
                 that befell me in my grief. Then was the grandest affliction
                 upon my heart that could be, under which I had surely 
                 fainted (as it was my desire, rather than to have lost
                 my joy and comfort) had not the almighty power and mercy of God miraculously upheld my spirit from sinking.</p>
            
            <p>
    
            <date when-custom="1668-09-16">On Wednesday</date>, I sent <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>

            poor and miserable life, which yet I despised in comparison
                 of him. So, with much impatience, great fears and some hope,
                 I waited until night, when  word was brought
                 me from <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName>
                 that I should <quote xml:id="q-788" type="allusion" source="#KJV_Acts_27:22">be of good cheer and not cast away my life</quote>,
                 for I should have <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> home as well as ever
                 I had him in my life.</p>
            <p>So that I endeavoured to comfort up my hopes in God, the
                 Almighty, whose power was infinite as his mercy and 
                 sweetest clemency to us his poor servants, had been often
                 showed. And poured out my prayers and tears abundantly that night for the preservation of the life and health of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
                 dear husband</rs> with me; if it were the good will and pleasure of our God that the dear and sweet union and affection
                 entire in our lives together might not be broke, nor we 
                 separated by death from the enjoyment of each other in him;
                 if this might stand with the gracious pleasure of our gracious
                 God, I made these, the requests of my soul, to him.</p>
            <p>That night was spent in some little slumbers, but very
                 unquiet and full of fears, tremblings and sad apprehensions.
            
                 In the morning, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> came home and very
                 discreetly prepared me, with good advice and counsel, to
                 entertain the Lord's determinate will in all things with 
                 patience and submission, if the worst should fall upon me
                according to my fears. But withal, said that God could raise
                 <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dearest joy</rs> up again were he never so weak (as I
                 had experience of) if he see it fit for us; although, indeed,
                 my dear heart was then very weak. At which words, my
                 faintings renewed with my exceeding sorrows for the fears of
                 being deprived of this, my sole delight in this world, next
                 under God. The Lord pardon my impatience in this concern,
                 which had, for the three last past years, been weaning him and myself
                from this world through great and manifold tribulations.</p>
            
            <p>
    
                Thus, betwixt hopes and fears, I remained until the next messenger came at four o'clock <date when-custom="1668-09-17">on Thursday</date> in the afternoon, at which
                 time I received the sad news (for me) of my most terrible
                 loss that any poor woman could have; in being deprived of my

                 marriage almost 17 years, so I might be his faithful
                 spouse in life and death. Great was my sorrow and extremity which had endured many <quote xml:id="q-789" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_25:18">sharp arrows</quote> from the
                 Lord, but this exceeded the rest of all temporal losses, crosses
                 and sorrows that ever befell me. Now, being under a fresh

                 part with me all in my sorrows and sufferings, comforted me
                  in sadnesses. We walked together in dear love and union:
                his love was mine, and I was his, in sickness and health, et cetera. In his
                sufferings,  I was afflicted: how can it be that I can subsist

                 until we could acquaint our remote friends and relations. But
                 the doctor told them that he had laid not long sick and taking
                 of physic would hinder that. Those that were helpers to bear
                 his corpse were of his kindred and relations:</p>

                 piety, peace, honesty. There was a great lamentation
                for him, God having given him much love and affection.</p>
            <p>But my sorrows and laments cannot be weighed for him, which
                 parted with the great and sole delight and comfort I esteemed of my
                 life. The Lord grant me some measure of patience to sustain
                that I may not displease the great governor of heaven and earth,

            <p>O Lord, our God, the God of our salvation, who for our
                 sakes were wounded and didest die to redeem
                 our souls from hell, and wast pleased to lie in the
                 grave that our sins might be buried by thee
                by an act of oblivion. But thou alone, of all that ever died,
                 were free amongst the dead to show thy sovereignty
                 and power over all, and of thy own power didst arise
                 again with victory and triumph over hell and the grave.
                 O powerful, almighty and omnipotent Jehovah, look
                 down from thy throne of majesty and mercy with a 
                 gracious eye of favour and compassion, and behold

            </head>
            
                   <l>Since nature's works be good, and death doth serve</l>
            <l>As nature's work, why should we fear to die?</l>
            <l>Since fear is vain, but when it may preserve,</l>
            <l>Why should we fear that which we cannot fly?</l>
            <l>Fear is more pain than is the pain it fears,</l>
            <l>Disarming human minds of native might:</l>
            <l>While each conceit an ugly figure bears,</l>
            <l>Which were not evil, well viewed in reason's light.</l>
            <l>Our only eyes, which dimmed with passions be,</l>
            <l>And scarce discern the dawn of coming day, </l> 
            <l>Let them be cleared, and now begin to see:</l>
             <l>Our life is but a step in dusty way.</l>
            <l>Then, let us hold the bliss of gracious mind,</l>
            <l>Since this we feel, great loss we cannot find.</l>

                 of his favours to young infants in their deliverances
                from death and destruction in this world, besides that of sicknesses and weakness of body; for if his divine providence did
                not send his angels to keep and guard little children, they
                 could not continue nor be preserved from all evil accidents

          <p>For, although their innocency be not capable of offending
                 others, yet that innocency and harmlessness is not able to
                 defend them from injurious dealings from evil
                 persons, neglects, and brutishness of nurses and carelessness of others; not to mention those infinite hazards
              of overlaying and badness of their food and evil milk
              (added to the dreadful malice of Satan, who doth

                  upon the chamber boards. I fell down upon 
                my face, fell to the ground and light with such a violent
                force (with all my weight on my chin bone upward)

                for I was not to be obtained, and she was sure he might
                 not have any encouragement for I was resolved not to marry.

                could not do. So, one Sunday morning, he brought the

                and was most vile and cruel in his oaths and swearing

                 me blind and into the air. And I had been a thorn in his

                her, this <persName ref="ppl:xl2">General Leslie</persName> did take notice of, and took her
                 money and bid her not trouble herself for he would
                 make him take it or punish him for his rudeness.
                He said more, did <persName ref="ppl:xi1">Innes</persName>, that if ever any of his
                country men came into <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName>, they would burn
                her and me and all she had. But yet, she served that God

            This was a great deliverance at last and joined with my

                    George Wandesford's</persName>). So, I saw myself in such apparent danger
                and begged of God to assist me and the poor beast I rid on, and to
               be merciful to me and deliver me out of that death for <quote xml:id="qx-959" type="phrase" source="#_Romans_15:30">Jesus Christ, 
               his sake</quote>, and the poor mare drew up her fore-feet and I
               perceived she did swim. I gave her the reins, and took off 
                 the short reins of the breech and gave her the head with all the
               help I could, and clasped my hands about her mane, did
                freely commit myself to my God to do what he pleased with me.
                And she did, by mercy, bear up her head and swimmed out
                above half a quarter of a mile across that dreadful river and, by
                God's great mercies, brought me over that river in safety<anchor xml:id="ev228-end" type="event"/> which deliverance
                was so great and dreadful that I can never forget to praise the good,

               and my great and gracieous, Lord God, who had pity on me
                at this time to spare me from this death and destruction.
                Oh, what shall I render to the great God of heaven who
                has delivered me from perishing by this water, and caused this poor
                creature to bring me out safe? <quote source="#BCP,_Holy_Communion,_after_Absolution" xml:id="q-954" type="paraphrase">All glory be to my gracious

                It was no small grief and trouble to me that
                the wickedness of <rs type="person">my eldest brother's servant</rs> 
                (by idle stories to <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my dear brother George</persName>
                against <persName ref="ppl:cw2">my poor brother Christopher</persName>) had so
                 far prevailed with him as to make a very
                great breach in their friendship, so that the younger
                 did apprehend himself much injured and
                 wronged thereby to his brother <persName ref="ppl:gw1">George</persName>
                
                
                 by them. And the other, though a very wise and understanding person, had been highly incensed
                 at some lies which was told of his brother to
                 him and by this means caused a very great
                 anger against each other, which proceeded to hie
                 and caused them to have such animosity as that 
                 they neither could be satisfied to receive the
                Holy Sacrament. </p>
           <p>But, it pleased God to make me the happy
                 instrument to persuade and entreat each of them
                 to such moderation and charity; to ask each other
                 pardon (and God in the first place) for what had been
               amiss and to freely forgive one another, and put away
                 all former disgusts or displeasure; and to be cordially
               reconciled for his sake, who died for us. And with great
               comfort, I prevailed with them to receive this holy feast
               of love to which we were to come, and on the Easter Day, I bless
               my God, we did receive that Holy  Sacrament in zeal and devotion.

            <l>Of a regardless element, we know</l>
            <l>Our great redeemer, from the parts below,</l>
            <l>Did by divine power, on the third day rise</l>
            <l>To open a nearer way to paradise.</l>
            <l>To that blessed place, my soul desires to fly:</l>
            <l>Lord, then, prepare me for it 'ere I die.</l>
            <l>Make me to repent, to watch, and pray,</l>
            <l>That so I may be ready for that day</l>
            <l>When thou shalt call this soul from me,</l>
            <l>With joyful hope, I'll come to thee. Amen.</l>
