      <l>I'll dedicate my soul unto my God: </l>
      <l>My childhood, nonage, youth is by his rod</l>
      <l>To be directed; his staff to uphold</l>

      <l>And by his bloodshed purchased heaven,</l>

      <l>Then on, my soul, do not decline</l>

          and, at last, to glorify her in heaven, which petitions, said she, 'whosoever shall make for me, the Lord hear
            and grant the same'.

          to forsake me; the devil accusing 
          my conscience; my sickness and weakness
          threatening my dissolution each minute.
          Yet did I desire to cast myself solely
          at the feet of the most gracious God
          whom I had offended and, though he should
          kill me, yet would I trust in him
          for pardoning and strengthening mercy.
          And it pleased him, in a most wonderful
           manner, to give me some comfort and
          stay, when I was almost past all
          hope, out of that blessed portion of
          scripture which our blessed saviour spoke
           in <ref source="#KJV_Matthew_11:28-30">St Matthew, the 11th chapter
             and 28, verses 29-30</ref>, which like lightning pierced into the secret of my heart
          and soul, bringing relief and some hopes of 
           comfort by his sweet and effectual call:

         <p>I laboured under and was heavy 
           laden 
             with
           
          the burden of my sins
          under the bondage of Satan:
           the one bringing me to slavery; the
          other of shame and torment, persuading me time was past for any help.
           But, lo, <quote source="#_Revelation_5:5" xml:id="q-032" type="partial">the lion of the tribe of Judah</quote>

          Yet, it pleased God that this mercy
          should not be forgotten. He did, I believe, set a mark upon <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son
          Robert's</persName> heart for a note of his deliverance
           at that time. For, when <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">the child</rs> was
           born, he had a very strange
         
            <pb xml:id="page-061"/>





         
         mark, just upon his heart, of  
          sprinkles of blood, pure and perfectly
          distinct round spots, like as if it had
          been sprinkled upon his skin and the 
          white perfectly appearing betwixt them
          and in the midst thereof, as if it had
          been cut with a knife, a longish cut.
          In this form it continued for half
          a year in its perfect colour, being
           seen oftentimes by myself, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
           <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, my two sisters and several others, with <rs type="person">the nurse</rs> and servants.
          This changed into the shape of a perfect
          heart, all the spots being contracted
          into one, in that form and colour. Then, by
          degrees, grew like a perfect 'T' of the same
          colour and continued so until <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">the child</rs>
          was near a year old and then it
           grew bluish and, by little and little, it
           went quite away, and no appearance
          thereof left of it.<anchor xml:id="ev51a-end" type="event"/></p>

         <p>This also must be imputed to the

          required at my hand, and that I had

          impulses upon my heart and desires to
          renew this grand ordinance of God,
          and in true and unfeigned repentance, faith,
    hope and charity to be made a partaker

           the same for many years during

           I — and do desire to — make it my utmost
          endeavour to inquire what is it that God
           aims at by all his providences and dealings.
          I find my heart too apt to forget what a
          low condition I was brought into by sickness
           and Satan, either as to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> or my

           forbid) why or wherefore he thus deals
          with me?</p>
         <p>It was his infinite goodness in giving me

          Oh no: I humbly acknowledge all these his

         <p>And to this main pillar of help and
          comfort to support my fainting, weak

          me from the pressures that then laid upon my
          injured person, which almost pressed me

         <l>I would be great, but yet the sun doth still</l>
         <l>Level his beams against the rising hill;</l>
         <l>I would be fair, but see the champion proud,</l>
         <l>The world's fair eye, oft setting in a cloud;</l>
         <l>I would be wise, but that the fox I see</l>
         <l>Suspected guilty, when the ass is free;</l>

          dreadful noise, and like guns and swords to
          war. When followed an infinite number
          of people, like common people and meaner
           sort,
          with raw-boned faces like Scots and Irish and
          English, all in a great confusion and hurry,
          as if running with arms and a posture of
          fighting and other instruments of war. These
          came before with loud clamours and shouts and
           noise. Then, a little distance after, came
          <persName ref="ppl:tw1">my Lord of Strafford</persName>, the Lord Lieutenant
           of Ireland, in mourning habit and, most
          sad and pensive, walked at a space by himself first, and then appeared as without a

          After my Lord, at a good pretty distance,
          appeared the perfect person of the good

          the other arm he held over the young

           the while of this appearance, loud noise
          and shouts and rude tumults in great
          horror with arms and guns. And all the
          while this appeared (which was so distinct
          and perfect that she did believe she really saw
          the real sight) the sky was so clear and
           at noontime of day which lasted about
           an hour or more to her very great

         Within a little while, <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> came

          asked him what he thought of this great
          sight, he would not show to her his trouble,
          but said dreams was not to be believed
          but bid her  refer all to the divine

          but most Christian-like begged of God to
          prevent and hinder those calamities to
          fall on the church and kingdoms, and prayed

           several times, with much trouble and sorrow
          still begging to God to divert his judgement.

          immediately before my dear <persName ref="ppl:kwd1">sister Danby</persName> died.
          I did see her laid on the childbed, all in white

           (<rs ref="ppl:fd1" type="person">the child</rs> coming double, with his buttocks

           told <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs>, 'I have had the strangest dream

           and sleeves, et cetera', I said. She asked what that meant.
           
           The man that brought the mournings, said that,
          when such things appeared in a child wife's
          chamber, it was a sign that that woman that

         I had a sad dream <date when-custom="1650-10">half a year before</date> my
          brother, <persName ref="ppl:gw1">George Wandesford</persName>, was lost. That he was
           going over this river and that it did rise then
           when he was in it, which so overcame him that he
          could make no help for himself and so was
          drowned in it. This dream did trouble me much
           and I waked in grief but, seeing it but a dream,
           I prayed it might never come to pass and fell asleep again. And dreamt the second time the same,
           which wakened me in much grief and fear, falling into
           a great sorrow and trembling until the morning.
         
           And then I was in trouble when my dear <persName ref="ppl:gw1">brother,
             George,</persName> came into the chamber and asked me what made
          me weep so sore. I answered it was for him. 'Why', said
          he, 'sister dost thou weep for me?' I said because he
          was so venturous to go over that dangerous <geogName ref="place:Swal_123">river
          Swale</geogName> and that I feared he might be lost in it. And
          begged of him, for God's sake, that he would not presume to
          go so when it was high, for I feared him much that
          a flood should destroy him; for I had had a dreadful
           dream that night concerning it and told him all the
              circumstances of it.</p>
         
            <pb xml:id="page-192"/>






        <p>At which he gave a sigh and said, for my sake,
          he would not venture again but have a care
          of himself, and gave me his hand he would not go
           over it again when it was high, which pleased me
          to hear this resolution.
      Nor did he ever until that
          day of his death go that way after, and then
           was compelled to it by reason of shortness of time.
           It was on <date when-custom="1651-03-31">Easter Monday</date>, when he came from <persName ref="ppl:hd1">Mr

          and myself and <persName ref="ppl:cw2">my brother, Christopher</persName>. One thing

          the menservants, that made debate amongst them
           so that they would not have received that holy feast.
           But it pleased God to give me that blessing that I did
          use all my utmost endeavours to reconcile them
           by all Christian persuasion, which I humbly praise God
          for I did at that time. And they were in perfect charity
          each to other and did both receive very reverently

          But, in the afternoon, my brother

          that she protested she did never hear the like.
          At which she admired, and said, 'Sir, I ever took you
           to be a fine gentleman and well-bred, but I did
           not think you had been so good a scholar and a divine'. 
          At which <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my dear brother</rs> answered with a deep sigh, and
          said, 'Ah, <persName ref="ppl:dbd1">Mrs Darcy</persName>, I have had the best advantage

          which words, she said, proceeded with great earnestness
          and was a great joy to her to hear them. But the Lord
          was not pleased to grant him a long life but to take
          him away in these good designs. And what he wanted
          in power, God accepted in the will in him.

          kneeling down very reverently, asked

          again kneel down and ask blessing. She said,
           'Son, you asked blessing but another you came in'.
          He said that he could not have too much of her prayers

          But as to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, he had

          was in dispute with him: for he had
          received it but would not give up
          his bond and statute without the payment
          of it. But I was so terrified at a
          suit that I told <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
          it was best to borrow and pay it that we
           might get quit of him. But <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
             husband</rs> would not, but said that he
          demanded it falsely and would not
          pay it. I said I had a friend that would
          lend him — meaning that <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> had
          given it me — but he would not do it:
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was to go to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> about
           it to quit him.<anchor xml:id="ev103b-end" type="event"/>

          and left me big with child of my seventh 
           child (my son, <persName ref="ppl:rt2">Robert Thornton</persName>). And he
          went away before we were settled,
           though I had brought all <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs>
           goods to furnish the house before I came
          into it. Nor had the neighbours come
          to welcome us into our house, as is the
          custom of the country, before <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> went,
          though they did do it to me in his absence and

         But, when he was gone to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>,
           one day in the morning, I fell into a dream, 
           being alone in bed, that <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr Nettleton's</persName>
          bailiff was come to distrain all my
          goods for that debt and put me into a
          great fright. When I wakened and that
           my maid, <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower</persName>, came into my chamber
            
           and to bedside, asked me if I was awake,
           <anchor xml:id="ev105-end" type="event"/>
           <milestone xml:id="ev105a-start" unit="event"/>
          I asked her to tell me truly, whether was
          <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton's</persName> bailiffs come. She, being in a wonder,
           asked who had been here. I said none, 
          for she locked me  in.
         </p>
         <p>At last, she said they was there, but prayed
           me not to be frighted for they was civil.
          I said, '<persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Wandesford</persName> should pay it'. But they
          would not go without the money; so it was
           much grief to me, though I had been lost if
          I had not had the dream beforehand.
          I bless the Lord, my God, for my delivery
           from death and miscarriage of <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear
            child</rs>. But I, by providence, had
           received 
             £100<am>l</am> of my portion that week, and had

         
            <pb xml:id="page-199"/>






         that £58<am>l</am> was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> that
          I had in the house, which I paid to them
          and so they got £158<am>l</am> of me that time,
          which by God's mercy did stop their mouths
          and I was delivered from death then,
          though I was brought very low.<anchor xml:id="ev105a-end" type="event"/></p>
