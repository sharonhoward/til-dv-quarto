         <l>Is that my glass may run but out the rest.</l>

         <l>Without thy help: see, see how fast they run!</l>

           <l>To count my winged hours: they fly so swift,</l>

         <l>Behold these rags: am I a fitting guest</l>
         <l>To taste the dainties of thy royal feast,</l>
         <l>With hands and face unwashed, ungirt, unblessed?</l>
         <l>First, let the Jordan streams (that find supplies</l>
         <l>From the deep fountain of my heart) arise,</l>
           <l>And cleanse my spots, and clear my watery eyes:</l>
         <l>I have a world of sins to be lamented;</l>

         <p>O Lord, who art the light of the world, the way,
            the truth, the life in whom there is no darkness,
            error, vanity nor death: the light, without which
            there is darkness; the way, without which there is 
            wandering; the truth, without which there is 
            error; the life, without which there is death.
            Say, Lord, let there be light, and I shall see thy
            light and eschew death (spiritual and temporal)
            and eschew darkness: I shall see the right way and
            avoid all wandering; I shall see the truth and
            shun errors; I shall see life and escape death.
            Illuminate, O dearest Jesus, illuminate my poor
            blind and weak soul, which sitteth in darkness and
            shadow of death, and direct my way and feet
            aright. Now I am encompassed with sorrows and
            in the shadows of death and way of despair.
            Oh, guide my feet in the way of peace. Amen.

             beyond all beings in heaven and earth. Thou, O Lord,

            hopes, either for this or a better life, since

            and from whom I hope for mercy in this time
            of my need and distress. For thou hast not

            prepared for me <quote xml:id="q-010" type="allusion" source="#_Job_5:9-10">times without number</quote>.

            and immediate providence now that I am solely
            left unto thee, whose protection is implored:
            thy wisdom to direct me and thy spirit to

            And all, with a full consent, did utterly deny anything of that nature. And, upon their oaths, did
            vindicate their wronged mistress from those

         <p>But <rs ref="ppl:mb1" type="person">the said woman</rs> did utterly deny that she

          I had likewise the great comfort of <rs type="group">several

            time until the extremity of my passion of grief
            was mitigated (by which I was almost killed).
            These, I thank God, was so fortunate as to
            return much satisfied of the goodness of God,
            who would not suffer me to lie too long under

            but, even in the midst of this misery, gave me

         <p>By the assistance of <rs type="group">these friends</rs> did I receive

            a distance) where I had been traduced: even my 
            very enemies themselves <quote xml:id="q-035" type="allusion" source="#_Titus_1:11">had their mouths 
            stopped</quote>. God being pleased that their consciences
            did accuse them and many of them did, with tears,
            acknowledge their sin in believing or hearing of
            lies against me (contrary to their own knowledge)
            and begged upon their knees for Christ's sake to
            pardon their wickedness: for they knew I was 
            innocent. These, to whom God had given the
            grace to repent, I prayed the Lord to forgive them,

            though they had done a very great wickedness
            and sinned against God and my innocent soul.
            But I knew that the same God which can raise my
            body from the grave will, for his own glory, also give
            a resurrection to my <quote xml:id="q-036" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote>, which yet was not
            touched nor blemished by any of my own deserts.
            Though Satan had raised up these storms to cast
            me into despair which, I hope, he never should 
            prevail against me in, nor make me cast away integrity, nor my hope in my dear saviour

            it pleased the divine wisdom to deprive me of
            the comfort of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> life,
            bringing me into another sad dispensation

    <milestone xml:id="ev2-start" unit="event"/>
         Even then did the Lord take from me the joy of

            Such was my fainting, dying spirits that 
            I fell
            into a sound at that dreadful news of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my joy's</persName>
            departure and that <quote xml:id="q-041" type="allusion" source="#KJV_Philippians_1:23">I desired to be dissolved and be

            to have entered those joys with him in glory.

         <p>
            But alas, I am not yet prepared for my

         <p>
            
            My faintings and weaknesses was so great and
            returned so strongly upon me — all that night and
            for two days after — that dear friends <rs ref="ppl:rt2 ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">and
            children</rs> did not expect but when I should have
            departed (having lost so much blood in the
            flood that broke upon me, by excess of grief, 
            at the first knowing of my slanderous accusation
            by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Anne Danby</persName> and her maid, <persName ref="ppl:bt1">Barbara Todd</persName>).</p>
         <p>
            Which now renewed on me again, so that I was
            reduced to great extremity and none hoped for my
            life a long time and  — but for the great and charitable
            kindness of <rs type="group">my friends</rs> which comforted me and
            prayed with me and for me in that most sad and
            desperate condition — I had utterly fainted
            and my soul had departed in that languishing
            condition (having now the heavy wrath of 
            my God, joined to the malice of my enemies,
            who had taken from me my greatest earthly 
            comfort away; leaving a desolate and helpless
            widow and my <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">three dear children</rs> orphans,
            and the estate over-burdened with debts and
            many sad encumbrances which was increased
            by the sicknesses and death of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>).

            Yet could I not be satisfied (neither as my

            desiring his body to be decently interred, and
            with as much circumstances of mournings
            to friends and other expenses concerning that
            sad occasion as the estate could allow.
            Nay, indeed, more than the law would
            allow, where an estate was so much charged
            with debts, besides the maintenance of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">all my
               three children</rs> (then but young).<anchor xml:id="ev5-end" type="event"/></p>
            
         <p>
            But, if it were an error in me, it was of the right
            hand: out of my love to him, and the honour I
            bore to his memory. And, therefore, was very
            willing to bear that burden upon myself
            and estate rather than see that last act of
            kindness to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> done to the
            lessening of the reputation of that family I so
            much loved and esteemed, and according to its
            worth and antiquity.</p>
         <p>
            I confess to have suffered some reproach
            from some who taxed me with too great expenses on that occasion. But I acted not alone
            in it, without the advice of my best friends,
            who ordered things with prudence and discretion
             and as necessity did require.</p>

            After the death and burial of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>,
            as before related, it fell out to be debated who 
            should take the administration of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
            goods and personal estate (and so be enabled 
            
            to act legally, 
            and to receive and pay debts) in regard
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-028"/>





         
            that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had not made any will
            how he would have things done in his estate.</p>
            <p>
            Which thing I had very often put him in
            mind to do, in regard of his sad fits of the palsy
            which might seize suddenly on him and deprive
            him of the satisfaction of leaving things done
            according to his mind. </p>
            <p>To which, he said that he had made a deed
            of settlement for <rs type="group">his children's</rs> maintenance
            and for portions for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">his two daughters</rs>,
               as also for the payment of his debts, and
               for <persName ref="ppl:rt2">his son, Robert</persName>, he knew I would take
               care of him and that he doubted not of that but he
               would want for nothing<anchor xml:id="ev7-end" type="event"/> which I could do.</p>
            <p>In regard that his estate was much charged
            already with debts which would and must be paid,</p>
         <p>
            I told 
            him that I knew debts ought to be paid
            but knew not what was owing by him. But
            to that end, to enable him to pay and for
            his satisfaction, I was willing to forgo
            my £1000 out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>. And to
            show my faithful affection to him and his
            family to do good to them all,
            I waived my own interest in that part of
            my portion which was  settled on me and my heirs.
            And also, by reason that the debts took up so 
            great a part of the estate out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> that
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-029"/>





         
            
         
         there could not be sufficient to discharge what
            was upon it and to maintain and educate <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my
               son, Robert</persName>, I was freely willing — of my own 
            choice — to show my entire love to himself and <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my
               son</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">two daughters</rs> to take that upon 
            myself. And to give him what allowance I was
            able out of what my own estate would allow
            (considering my present circumstances which was
            but low) if all the debts could not be otherwise
            paid and satisfied, and God forbid they should 
            not be paid which was justly proved.</p>
         <p>And I hoped he would think it fit (and 
            but just) that I should have a competent
            maintenance, who had brought so considerable a fortune to the estate and to him.</p>
         <p>
            Also, he knew that my £1000 out of
            <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> was stated and settled by articles and bond
            before marriage to be laid out in land for the
            longer liver of us two and the heirs of our bodies.
            And that <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was entailed upon my heirs
            male by the said articles of marriage (as may
            appear) which would have fallen upon <persName ref="ppl:rt2">his son, Robert</persName>,
            after his decease — as was intended by us — without charge.
            There was also provision by a deed of settlement
            and for maintenance, education and portions for
            the younger children out of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> before
            marriage, which</p>

         by his unfortunate engagement in that affair
               of the assignment of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton</persName> (Date: <date when-custom="1658-08-12">August 2nd, 1658</date>) of the
            resignation of the Irish estate of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs>
               to pay debts and portions and legacies </p>
            <p>which, alas, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> was persuaded
            to undertake by the advice of his uncle
               <persName ref="ppl:rd1">Richard Darley</persName> (and that so he might, having that
               estate in his own hand,  satisfy himself first of what was due to myself and
               <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> arrears due to her from thence).</p>
            <p>But this was done by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>, indeed,
            without <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> consent or knowledge
            of my own, and we both did before that desire
            and entreat him never to do it. For all our
            interests was sufficiently secured by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
               dear and honoured father's</rs> will and deeds, and we
            might have been paid our dues in the first
               if we had demanded it legally
               (whereas, the taking upon him the assignment
               of the whole trust did involve him in the charge
            and made him liable to be sued by <rs type="group">the creditors</rs>).

            and he confessed it — with a great grief to him —
            that he did not take our advice, but on the

            <p> 
            he had not done it. But now it was too late, and
            he had repented it 100 times;

          <milestone xml:id="ev9-start" unit="event"/>for it was

            that he was forced to give <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr Nettleton</persName> 
            bond and judgement for his debt. And entered into a statute,
         </p>
         <p>whereupon <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> sued him to an

            with so great malice until he compelled him to
            take that course which he was very sorry to do;
            that was, to sell the estate at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName>
            (which was settled for his younger children's provision) and to pay, with £1000 of that money, <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr

            <milestone xml:id="ev10-start" unit="event"/>
            As for the other part of the money, being £1000,
            I desired <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> he would be pleased
            to pay with it his two brothers (<persName ref="ppl:tt1">Thomas</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:jx2">John</persName>)
            and his two sisters (<persName ref="ppl:etd1">Elizabeth</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:ftp1">Frances</persName>) their
            portions with it: for I could not endure to see
            their portions unpaid which was due to be done —
            by his own engagement — when they cut
            off the entail to enable him to make settlement
            of marriage for himself (without which he could
            not expect a fortune with a wife).</p>
            <p>But <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> said he would not do that,
               for he could purchase a rentcharge with it (of

            and sisters interest out of that.</p>
            <p>I was neither convinced nor satisfied
            with that way, but rather desired the other,
            because that debt had been sooner satisfied
            and his estate more clear and their portions paid.
         </p>
            <p>But <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> took his way with it and
            it proved to be worse, and that rentcharge
            was afterwards sold to <persName ref="ppl:xd1">Mr Danby</persName> to pay

            At <placeName ref="place:Ches_012">Chester</placeName>,
            
               
               at that time,
            
            <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> was 
            desired by <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle (William Wandesford</persName>) to

            which he would
            keep for <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother, George</persName>. She made many 
            excuses and would not willingly have given it
            him, but done it herself, as most proper for her.
            But at last, she found him discontented and was
            willing to oblige his kindness to herself and
            children. She committed it into his care and custody,
            with charge to preserve it (as the richest jewel she
            had) to be continued in the family and given to <persName ref="ppl:gw1">her
               son, George</persName>, on the first opportunity which he did protest faithfully he would . But, alas, it was afterwards in the wars lost (as he said) with all his writings.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-042"/>





         
         <p>
            But the suddenness 
            and
             surprise <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William</persName> took
            her in did prevent her intentions of taking
            a copy of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father's</rs> Book before he
            got it from her, and she was but newly come into
            <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> (and but a stranger) wanted time to take
            a copy; therefore, desired to let her have a copy
            of it from him which he did promise her.</p>
          <p>Though the wars, growing hot betwixt <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs>
             and parliament, caused <rs ref="ppl:ww1" type="person">my uncle</rs> to fly for
            safety and leave the said book into the custody
             of some friends — with his own evidences of all
             his estate which the parliament party seized on — 
             yet, blessed be God, I have great cause to
            acknowledge his great goodness in the preserving one copy of the said book (which now
             I am so happy to enjoy one writ out by it).</p>
          <p>
            And although the manuscript
             itself was
            so unhappily gone from the whole family,
            and that none of his children was so happy
            to see <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">our dear and blessed father</rs>, his advice,
            under his own hand (writing to <persName ref="ppl:gw1">his dear
               son, George</persName>) but myself who read it several
            times over when in <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> keeping.</p>
          
         <p>
            The benefit whereof I would 
            not have wanted
            for great riches, when I had his advice to us by his
            own pen, and esteemed it a great mercy to me in
            particular whose counsel was most piercing to my 
        [heart]
     </p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-043"/>





         
         <p>
            and when I could bear witness myself that
            his advice to <rs type="group">his children</rs> was zealously practised
            by himself in his life and holy conversation.</p>
         <p>
            And
             it has been my great grief that no 
            good friend's pen could have leisure in those
            sad times to write us an account to the world of
            his eminent, holy, wise, prudent and pious life and
            conversation, whose virtues was so eminent that
            he lives fresh in the memories of all that knew
            him; if it had been writ out, it would continue
            his memory forever.
         </p>
          <p>We must, therefore, rest ourselves contented in

            I have one little book in my study which is but

         <p>but I value it above all the books in my

            <p>Upon which, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> said that he

               had many times (with tears) lamented the 
               loss of it extremely and would be overjoyed
               to have but a copy of it; asking <rs ref="ppl:jd5" type="person">my cousin</rs> how
            he had it and came by it because the original
               was lost many years ago (as I told him).</p>
         <p><rs ref="ppl:jd5" type="person">My cousin</rs> told him the truth of it. That it
            was, indeed, writ out in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> by his son,
            <persName ref="ppl:td5">Timothy Dodsworth</persName>, who was <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my lord deputy's</rs>
            servant, and one whom my lord had a peculiar
            kindness for (intending to make him his secretary).
            And, when <rs type="person">my lord</rs> had come home from the
            council table, did every night for an hour or two
            write in that book before he went to bed.
            And, after that he was in bed, made him read in
            some good book and instructed him in it, and so continued
            until <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my lord</rs> was overcome with sleep (he not going
            to bed until twelve or one o'clock at night and rise again
            by five or six in the mornings).</p>

            something of the subject (that it was of an
            excellent nature, as this that came from him)
            thought it would be of great advantage
               to himself in point of instruction (being a
               young man and but coming into the world).</p>
            <p>And so, without <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my lord's</rs> knowledge, did
            copy it over himself, as well as he could by

            sat many nights up the most of it to do
               it; for he durst not have done it if <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my lord</rs>
            had discovered him.</p>
            <p>'I confess', said <rs ref="ppl:jd5" type="person">my cousin</rs>, 'it was a very bold
            part in him to do it — and what he ought not —
            but since it so fell out that the original
            of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my lord's</rs> book was lost, I think it was
            very well that we had something of him,
            though it be not so perfectly writ as by day one
            might correct the mistakes that n'er

            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> begged the book of him for

            But the treaty of marriage being then begun,

            and <persName ref="ppl:jw1">John</persName>, and by myself part of it.

            The witnesses to <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> will were as follows:

            And this very copy has been ever since in <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs>

            came heir (upon the sad loss of <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my dear brother,

            being many times asked by myself and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my

            he would please to give us that copy of the

            gone into <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> on purpose to get one
            out of the court to do right to every one of us
            by it. And also, he, himself, promised faithfully
            to us he would do so too when <rs ref="ppl:ww1" type="person">my uncle</rs>
            gave it him in our sight and would let
            us have it to copy one by it. After <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother
               George, his death,</persName> he would sometimes have said we should
            have it and he would bring it with him, and other
            times say he had forgotten it but indeed
            we should have it next time.</p>
          <p>And afterwards, about half a year,
            I begged it and prayed him for God's sake to
            let me have it, for I could not get my 
            dues of the tenants which was to pay me by
            <rs ref="ppl:mn1" type="person">my uncle's</rs> assignment out of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>
             (which he knew to be true and had gone with me to
             help me to get it of them before he was married).
             Then, he told me that he had laid it where
             he knew not how to find it, nor knew not
             where it was, except <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John Lowther</persName> had it.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-055"/>





         
          <p>At which answer, I was surprised and much 
            concerned, fearing some ill consequence to
            follow to us because he
             had got it into his hand,
         </p>
         <p>though I was hopeful that <rs ref="ppl:cw2" type="person">my poor brother</rs> would
            not be prevailed with to do anything contrary to
            his knowledge of the will of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> (if he
            did but understand the thing rightly).</p>
          <p>So, I still entreated him to look for it and
             get it from <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John</persName>, but durst not speak
             my fears to show any distrust of <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John</persName>.</p>
          <p>But, after this time, <persName ref="ppl:cw2">my brother Christopher</persName>
            would never be known that he had found
            the copy, nor had we any other but that which
            was writ out by us all, in parts, which we repaired
             to on all occasions.</p>
         
      
        
         <p>
            It was about this time that the will was

            It being very late they had their discourse that time — I think, at <persName>Sober's</persName> in <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond </placeName> — and <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William</persName> fell asleep on the

            discoursed on their business.</p>
          <p>At last, <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John</persName> told <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother, George</persName>,
            that he would never have his estate his

            would his estate.</p>
         <p>
            At which motion of <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John Lowther</persName> (was
            <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my dear brother</rs>, being extremely offended) said, '<persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John</persName>, I will never do so unworthy and unjust an action, nor have my

              some other words, we parted and the

            then they proceeded to search the rolls 
             office, where the will was proved and put
            on the file as I have related before.</p>
          <p>But since that time (in the year <date when-custom="1647">1647</date>) and
             this year (<date when-custom="1652/1653">1652 or 1653</date>) there had been a

             the government since <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother, George Wandesford</persName>,
             had taken the copy of the will as before related.
            And when search was made for it there,
             there was found no will on the file, nor any
            footsteps of such a will: all things being 
            changed by the <persName ref="ppl:oc1">Protector Cromwell</persName> and his
            instruments, and all those wills and testaments
             then on the file they found was all destroyed
            by the malice of the soldiers and others;
            so that all the kingdom was at a most
            sad loss and damage, and many families was
            destroyed for want of those settlements that
             was then awanting.</p>
         <p>I suppose this news did not a little please

            and forthwith put these designs

            Christopher</persName>, that there was a will of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">his

            appears by the testimonies aforesaid. Which

            the conscience of <rs ref="ppl:cw2" type="person">my said brother</rs> — that it
            was no forgery, nor false pretentions of

            money as well as my portion out of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>.</p>
         <p>
            So that this consideration, as touching

            let it appear in public as a witness against

          <p> 
            (and not discerning the sin at the bottom

          <p>He, perceiving the will was lost and that

            Of the Manner How <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">My Honoured Father's</rs>
            Last Will and Testament was Found
            after the Loss of It for Many Years
         </head>
         
          <p>It is much to be observed by us, the
             children of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs>, how he
             (the God of mercies) took care of us and
            all our concerns in giving leave that
             all things was done for the right establishment of peace in this family, and for
            provision and the establishment thereof
             by his will and deeds, and that the will was
            done so legally that we could not totally
             be destroyed (though our adversaries endeavoured
            it to the utmost and to take that advantage
             when the will seemed to be lost).</p>
         <p>
            But yet, I cannot but acknowledge
            the immense goodness of our gracious God in
            this very particular — of its being off the
            file — was the only way to have it be
            preserved to posterity.</p>

            I took notice before, when <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my dear
               brother, George</persName>, had been in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> to

         get a copy of the will, he said that he had
            not money to discharge the court for
            the copying of so large a great will, and
            that he would send the sum over to
            pay for it (which, as I remember, was £5<am>l</am>
            or £6<am>l</am>,
            with fees and all the charges belonging to it).</p>
         <p>
            But he could not get monies to pay
            with: we got very little out of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs>
            and for herself to live on, <anchor xml:id="ev45-end" type="event"/><milestone xml:id="ev46-start" unit="event"/>and so the wars
            came still on and <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my poor brother, George</persName>, was
            forced to fly for safety from one place to
            another (until his sequestration was got
            off by the means of <persName ref="ppl:rd1">my uncle, Richard
            Darley</persName>, who traversed it for him).<anchor xml:id="ev46-end" type="event"/></p>

            to <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> by the wath at the end of the
             ground of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> pasture,</p>
          <p>but a flood did arise while he was in

         <p><rs type="person">The poor clerk</rs> died and <persName ref="ppl:xk2">Mr Kerney</persName> still
            kept the chest under safe custody, and none

            Finding also, <persName ref="ppl:rw4">Mr Ralph Wallis</persName>, his hand,

          <p><persName ref="ppl:xk2">Mr Kerney</persName>, knowing <persName ref="ppl:rw4">Mr Wallis</persName> his

             <persName ref="ppl:rw4">Mr Wallis</persName> answered, 'Yes', he had reason

             'but why do you ask that question?' <persName ref="ppl:xk2">Mr Kerney</persName>
             said, 'Do you know your hand when you

          <p>At which, <persName ref="ppl:xk2">Mr Kerney</persName> produced <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear

             the last act <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">his lord</rs> did: to confirm and ratify
            the said last will and testament. Saying, with
             a sad heart, for the want of this will to set
             all right amongst the family we were almost destroyed, asked him how he came by
            it, who told him all the said circumstances as before related.</p>
          
          <p>To which he answered, it was the greatest
            
           providence of God that it was off the file
            in those sad times for they would have 
             been destroyed</p>
          <p> and was also the mercy of God to have
             it now found and restored again, which he hoped
            would be a means to preserve <rs type="group">that noble
            family</rs> from ruin for want of it.</p>
          <p>He did also assure him, he should be
            gratefully paid for those moneys due
            for the copy <persName ref="ppl:gw1">Mr George Wandesford</persName> had,
            though God knows what a loss there was of <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">that brave
            gentleman</rs> in that family. </p>
          <p>After this, <persName ref="ppl:rw4">Mr Wallis</persName> did with speed and
             great joy acquaint <persName ref="ppl:jb7">Mr Burniston</persName> with it,
            which did much rejoice of its being found
             and attested his hand as witness to it also.

         <p>
            After <persName ref="ppl:rw4">Mr Wallis</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:jb7">Mr Burniston</persName> had consulted of that business of the will being found,
            they judged it absolutely necessary to seek out
            for <persName ref="ppl:wm1">William Metcalfe</persName> (<persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> agent) for that 
            employment; acquainting him with that happy
            news of its restoration and of the occasion of the
            will's being taken off the file, as before mentioned.
            All of them did agree with speed to acquaint <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my

          <p>So, <persName ref="ppl:jb7">Mr Burniston</persName> did write to <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle

             <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dead, dear father</rs>
            which most happy news was so great a

         <p>It was matter of great joy to us, who was
            in great danger to be utterly ruined in our estate
            for the want of it, and especially to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
               husband</rs> by the assignment of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Mr Norton</persName>,
            whereby he was so deeply obliged and that
            estate to pay debts was like to be pulled unjustly
            from <rs type="group">the children</rs> and creditors of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs>.</p>

             was by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> order to <persName ref="ppl:wm1">William Metcalfe</persName> fully
             paid and, by advice of <persName ref="ppl:rw4">Mr Wallis</persName>  and <persName ref="ppl:jb7">Burniston</persName>,
            the said original will was again put on the
             file with all the essential ceremonies belonging to
             it. And there, I hope, it will remain preserved
             to the use of the family forever. <anchor xml:id="ev49-end" type="event"/></p>

            of the truth of the said will being found. And
            they put us to a great deal of trouble and cost
            to produce witnesses and such evidences on
            oath that compelled them to be satisfied of the truth

         The mercies of my gracious Father in heaven

               Thorpe</persName>, who took cognisance of the matter,
            and an agreement was stated amongst us.</p>
         <p>All suits ended, and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was
            to deliver up the estate of <placeName ref="place:Cast_085">Idough in Ireland</placeName>
            to trustees upon the performance of the said
            trust of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my honoured father's</rs> last will and testament,
            which was entered into bond to be done by <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher
               Wandesford</persName> for the performance of the same, according
            to that will which he had so much denied
            before. (The Lord pardon his great sin.)</p>
         <p>
            Yet, by the great providence of the Almighty God, he had brought the truth to pass : that
            he could not enter into possession of <rs ref="place:Cast_085" type="place">that land</rs>
            of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">his father</rs> without the satisfaction of debt,
            portions and creditors due to be paid out of
            the same. (<quote xml:id="q-052" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_72:19">Blessed be the Lord, our God, forever</quote>.)</p>
          <p>Which by this agreement, with <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William</persName>
             and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, according to <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron
            Thorpe's</persName> arbitration, all things (blessed be God)
             was stated and compromised, and deeds and

             us by <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford, my brother</persName>, and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my

         <p>By virtue of the said agreement, there
            was made three deeds, or rentcharges, to secure
            a rentcharge to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> for all his
            moneys due to him out of the said lands
            of <placeName ref="place:Cast_085">Idough in Ireland</placeName> to secure the sum
            of £2000 to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>.</p>
          <p>
             Videlicet: to pay my own £1000,
             part of my portion, which by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> will
            he gave me out of his land in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, as an increase  of what he had already given me out of
             <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>: videlicet, £1500
             portion.
         </p>
         <p>
            I, having due to me in all, by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> 
            will and testament, the sum of £2500 as 
            portion. Besides, I ought to have by his will
            a sufficient allowance for maintenance and 
            education until I came to the age of 21 years
            or marriage (which first happened, with consent
            of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs>) to be maintained according to my degree and quality, which maintenance
            I never yet got one penny of it though due for
            many years: so, I was not burdensome for that,
            yet it doth still remain due to me.</p>
          <p>Also, <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName> did by that rentcharge pay and satisfy <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> for that

            <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">his father's</rs> will
            to our great sorrow and affliction (because he knew
            there was one, and had acted according to it in
            his own behalf and mine when he was a younger
            brother) —</p>

          
         <p>
            by reason of all these circumstances, the
            acting in that business proved of an unhappy
            consequence to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> and his estate,
            and created him more trouble than ever he
            would have known.</p>
          <p>
            For, on the contrary, if he had not been engaged
            in that trust to pay off debts faster than it could
            by their suing him for them — after he had 
            given <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> security for his, then did <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my
            uncle William Wandesford</persName> demand his debt from <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            and so took up the rents with charges more than
            was gotten out of the land — by reason of which, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
            Thornton</persName> was forced to enter into debt and to
            sell his land at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> to pay them </p>
          <p>(which, with interest and public charges, outrun

            Whereas, on the contrary, if <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had
            only stuck to my mother's interest of £300<am>l</am> per annum
            out of <rs type="place">that estate</rs> annuity for her life,</p>

         <p>
            which was due for 19 years after <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
               father's</rs> death, and was first charged on the
            trust, being in lieu of that estate due by law
            for thirds and so settled by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs> by
            deed of annuity, and confirmed by his will.</p>
         <p>
            The sum which was due to her being to the
            value of £6000. I heard
            <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John Lowther</persName> promise <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> for it
            £1500 for to quit her
            interest there.</p>
          <p>
             I do believe she would have accepted of it,
            if left to herself, but the same <rs ref="ppl:mn1 ppl:rd1" type="group">parties</rs> which advised <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> to the taking on him the trust did
             advise <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> to the contrary, and so she
            did not accept of <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John's</persName> motion when he was
            to pay her that money all down at a payment.
            However, she would have made over her
            dues there to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, by which he might
            have entered on the estate in her right,<anchor xml:id="ev58a-end" type="event"/></p>
          
         <p>
            and so have had an entire interest before
            debts however might have been sharers with them.</p>
          
          <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev59-start" unit="event"/>
         
            Also, there was a right due to <persName ref="ppl:jw1">my poor 
               brother, John Wandesford</persName>, of £6000
            out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>,
            which fell on him by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> will when
            <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Christopher</persName> became heir by <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother George Wandesford's</persName>
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-083"/>





         
            death without heirs, as now it was. And he made
            me, his only sister, his executor and gave it to
            me (besides there was my own portion of
             £1000 which was to have been paid
            from that estate without dispute).<anchor xml:id="ev59-end" type="event"/></p>
          
          
         <p>
            Now, if all these interests should have failed,
            it would have been strange and an unaccountable
            
            thing when there was such an estate, worth
            £2000 a year to pay it out
            on, besides a great colliery.</p>
          
          <p>
    
            But there was no fear by God's grace
            of that, being all secured by the will, by which right
            was obtained what I did enjoy; having also
            <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William Wandesford's</persName> security and deed of
             annuity of two rentcharges — first, of £100 per annum for six years; the second, for £200 per annum for five years to be received out
            of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName> for my £1500 — <milestone xml:id="ev60-start" unit="event"/>besides other and
            better security by articles made betwixt <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my
               said uncle William</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:cw2">my brother, Christopher Wandesford</persName>,
             and <persName ref="ppl:rd1">my uncle, Richard Darley</persName>,  in my behalf 
            before my marriage.</p>
         <p>
            Upon which the articles of marriage was made
            betwixt <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and  <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>, with the
            settlements of his estate at <placeName ref="place:East_019">East Newton</placeName>, et cetera.  
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-084"/>





         
         And <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was made according to the
            several articles and agreements at that time
            (<date when-custom="1651-07-02">July 2nd,
               1651</date>) as may more at large appear.

         <p>
            But since things fell out contrary to our
            hopes and desires for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> peace and
            quiet, with more impairing of our estate than
            could have been wished, we have great reason to bless and praise the Lord, our God, that
            it was no worse, which it would have been without doubt had not divine providence so
            ordered that the will of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs>
            was, first, out of harm's way and off the file
            when those lawless times endured.</p>
          <p>And yet to be found in due time, when we
             were like to be overthrown by our adversaries,
            and even in the nick of time to be produced
             to preserve us (and all who had an interest in
             it) from destruction.</p>
         <p>
            Therefore, we may 
            say in regard of this providence of the will, as a good man said of himself:

         <p>Having lived a sweet, quiet and comfortable

         But lest I should not be sensible enough
            of the change of life which would befall me in that
             estate —
             from that most free and happy opportunities
             of serving my God, as St Paul speaks of the <quote xml:id="q-265" type="allusion" source="#_1Corinthians_7:34">virgin</quote> — 
            </p>
         <p>
             I did that night about supper time or at 
            
               
            two
            
               
             o'clock, fall into a most violent fit of a sudden
            sickness with pains of my head and back and stomach
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-133"/>





         
            
            
         
         in a fever and ague, which seized on me in so
            great a violence that it caused me to vomit and
            purge extremely, until my strength was almost
            gone, and brought into great faintings for eight hours long.</p>
         <p>Which condition was extremely bewailed by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            husband</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs>, and my friends, and looked upon
            as a sad omen to my future comfort.
            And I do confess, I was very desirous to have
            then delivered up my miserable life into the hand
            of my merciful redeemer, who I feared I had 
            offended by altering my resolves of a single life.</p>
          <p>This sickness (as to natural causes) proceeded
            from a desperate cold taken the night before upon
            washing my feet, which I never used to do in such
             cold time of the year, in deep of winter. And so that
             struck up into my head and stomach and caused that
             great and violent extremity of vomit and purging.</p>
          <p>But, after the great cleansing of my stomach
            and upon all the means could be used, it pleased
            my gracious God to look upon me in much 
             mercy and to abate my sickness and torments, and did
            give me some ease that night and caused me to
             sleep tolerably well. Thus, was the first entrance
            of my married life, which began in sickness and
            continued in much afflictions and ended in great
            sorrows and mournings.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-134"/>





         

          <p>So that — which was to others accounted the 
            happiest estate — was embittered to me at the
            first entrance and was a caution of what
            trouble I might expect in it; as was hinted 
             by St Paul's Epistle, <quote xml:id="q-266" type="direct" source="#_1Corinthians_7:28">such shall have trouble in
             the flesh</quote>.
               
         <anchor xml:id="ev99-end" type="event"/></p>
          
          <p>I only had the hopes of comfort in <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            dear husband</rs>, whose sweet and good
            conversation alleviated much of my other
            sorrows. Thou, O Lord, my God, did not forsake
            me in the midst of my pains and sickness
            
            
            when I was brought very low, but gave me
            help, strength and comfort to endure thy hand
            gently, laying it on me as a trial and graciously taking it off me again in a short time,</p>
         <p> so that I saw thy power, thy justice and
            thy clemency to spare my life in this world
            to serve thee in a married estate as well 
            
            as in a single life (in which I was well pleased,
            if <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> and friends had seen it fit).</p>
          <p>But since, by thy divine providence, I am
             entered into this estate of marriage, I beseech
             thee, O Lord, to give me those graces and gifts which
            I want and what is requisite to make me a suitable wife (as thy servants <quote xml:id="q-267" type="allusion" source="#_Genesis_11-23 #_Genesis_24:36 #_Genesis_25:10-12">Sarah</quote> and <quote xml:id="q-268" type="allusion" source="#_Genesis_24-27 #_Genesis_29:12">Rebecca</quote> was)

          After my recovery of this illness, it pleased
             God to cause me to conceive with child, and I
            was much afflicted in breeding and fell sick
             always after meat — never digesting or came
             to nourish or strength me — </p>
         <p> which condition was a great alteration from 
            the healthy constitution I always had enjoyed.
            But being from that cause of hopes of the blessing

            forward in the distemper by the extreme heat
            of the weather at that time (when the extreme

          <p>At which time, I was big with child and the sight of it

            and a cold storm for a time did possess the earth.</p>
         <p>
            Which dreadful change did put me into most

             <geogName ref="place:Whit_127">Whitestone Cliff</geogName> which I knew not, but was a mile to the
            bottom, where I could not tread one step even
             down but on my toes (being held up by <persName ref="ppl:sg2">my maid,
                Susan Gosling</persName>) which so strained my body, being near
             my time, that I went down in pain and did
            sweat exceedingly.</p>
         <p>But this <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> would not have had
            me gone down this way (but by <placeName ref="place:Ampl_102">Ampleforth</placeName> about
            and plane way) but for <persName ref="ppl:xb11">Mr Bradley</persName>, who told him
            it would not do me no hurt because <rs ref="ppl:xb14" type="person">his wife</rs>
            went down that way and was no worse.</p>
          <p>However, this effect to me was contrary; for
             I, being to go to <persName ref="ppl:ja2">my cousin Ayscough's</persName>, she did admire
            that I came that way and wished I might get safe home.</p>
          <p>It was, indeed, the good pleasure of my God to
             bring me safe home to <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> house <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>,

             but my dangerous journey — the effects of it — did
             soon appear on me and <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie's</persName> words came true.

For as soon as I got home, I fell into the most 
            dreadful sickness that ever any creature could
            possibly be saved
             out of, and by a strong and putrid
             fever (which was on me 11 days before <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName>
             came from <placeName ref="place:Hull_027">Hull</placeName>) had so putrefied my whole blood
             that both myself and <rs ref="ppl:xt1" type="person">poor infant</rs> was like to go.</p>
          <p>But when <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">the doctor</rs> came post, I heard that post
             sound and, though I was almost past speaking, did
            yet rejoice in hopes he would let me blood which
             by no means else I thought I could not live.</p>
          <p>I was so recruited a little moment, when
             he saw me, that he thought to let me blood forthwith
             but, after a little space, I fell down so ill that he
            durst not do it until he had given me something
             to cause an hour's sleep (which I had not done in all
             my sickness before). Upon which, he did let blood
             and then, in a quarter of an hour's time, I bless my God,
            I grew better.</p>
         <p>
            (The more particular description of this great
            and long-lasting sickness, I have related in my 'First
               Book of My Life' and with the miraculous deliverances
            was towards me in all that time.)<anchor xml:id="ev106-end" type="event"/></p>

            For after my miscarriage of <rs ref="ppl:xt1" type="person">that sweet
               infant</rs>, which I bore with great difficulty and it was
            sodden in my womb by the fever, it could not
            live a quarter of an hour until we could get it baptised,
            though we sent for <rs type="person">a minister</rs> to do it.

         And after that I fell into a long-lasting ague,
            sometimes by a tertian, and then every day had
            it until I sweat and changed three times in one day and night.</p>
          <p>Then I fell into the jaundice after the ague,
             which so continued with me so terribly that my strength,
             my might, my hopes was gone of life.</p>
          <p>The hair on my head came off, my nails off
             my fingers and toes came off, my teeth did shake
            and ready to come out and grew black. </p>
          <p>And thus did this dreadful, chronical disease
             remain on me so long that — in all these things —
            I continued out of one distemper into another
            for the space of nine months, with the relapses and the
            weaknesses that followed: so that it was from the

          <p>Thus, have I passed the first two years of

            After the Lord vouchsafest me a degree
            of strength and recovery — out of that desperate,
            long-lasting sickness by five or six several relapses
            down into an ague, from which God did at last
            bring me through much weakness and faintings — </p>
          <p>
             about a quarter of a year, I found myself as if I was in a breeding condition and
            very often sick, as in those cases with me, after
            meat.</p>
          
          <p>
    
         Which was some hopes to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> I
            might possibly be better in health, after I was
            with quick child and so, I bless God, I was for
            some time. But about the same of the year, in
            <date when-custom="1653-08">August</date>, when my first sickness began and that
            I was about 11 or 12 weeks gone, I perceived <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">the
               child</rs> to move and that I was with 
            which was a great joy to us both (hoping I might
            have missed the fever).</p>
          <p>But <date when-custom="1653-08">about that time in August</date>, I found <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">the child</rs>
             for three weeks very lively and well. But, after a while,</p>
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-145"/>





         
          <p>
I found myself very hot and feverish, and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">the child</rs>
            did not move at all which caused me to be afraid
             of a relapse into the same distemper as on the first.
            
            
             And, therefore, begged of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs>
             they would please to give me leave to be let blood,</p>
          <p> which they consented to, and I got <persName ref="ppl:xm1">Mr Mahum</persName> to do
            it. And took four or five ounces from my arm, upon which I
            found a most quick change and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">the poor infant</rs>
            did spring in my womb, very lively and strong, by the

          <p>Blessed be the infinite mercy of God, who had

         <p> she fell into a most desperate fit of the

            grew black in her face, which sore frighted her
            maid, <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower</persName>. She took her up immediately and, with the help of the midwife, <persName ref="ppl:jr1">Jane Rimer</persName>,
            to open her teeth and to bring her to life again.</p>

            the extreme excess of those (upon the fright and
            terror came upon me) so great floods that I was
            spent and my breath lost. My strength departed

            not expect my life but overcome with sorrow for me.</p>

            Nor durst they tell me in what a condition <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my

         <p>
            Which did so suddenly affright me, being

            After <persName ref="ppl:et1">my dear Betty's</persName> death — about a quarter of 
            a year — it pleased God I had hopes of breeding another child which might be a comfort to us and an

            I always breed my children very sickly and ill

            a desperate fall, which I fell upon my hands and knees
               to save <rs ref="ppl:xt2" type="person">my child</rs>. But the very weight of my body
            (with the fall over the threshold in the hall at <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>)
            did so shake me that <rs type="person">the child</rs> was turned wrong in
            my womb. I, being then big with child, wanted but ten

            take a little respite to make me to go through what
             I was to do. But she made me go to bed, and then
            my pains sharpened so fast they could not get
            me up nor could she deliver me in the bed.</p>
          <p>But, at length, got me on the stool (with my clothes
             half on and shoes off) and, about two or three o'clock in the

            the labour more hard; so that I was upon the
             rack for six hours together in torment, and crying
            so long and bitter that my poor body was as if
            parted limb from limb; so that I grew speechless and breathless a long time, for <rs ref="ppl:xt2" type="person">this dear

             first, one foot came; then, the other was drawn
             down. Then, the arms being over his head and
             shoulders, so that she wrought upon my poor

             on his hips and thighs, which stuck fast, which — having

            all this while was I in exquisite torture.</p>
          <p>Then did she work down and fetch his arms:
             at one time after did bring down the other, when

             pull away his head and neck with such a force — not
            giving me time or space to breathe — that both our breaths
            was lost

            Though we could not have the happiness of baptism for

             the Lord for his salvation: he requiring no more than

         <p>I was delivered in the manner rehearsed by the fall I

         It was the good pleasure of my gracious God
            to continue me in life, though in much weaknesses, after
            the excess loss of blood and spirits both in my childbed
            and the loss of blood and strength by the haemorrhoids,

         followed every day by siege caused by my
            last sore travail and sad childbirth.</p>
         <p>This brought me so low and weak that fainted
            every day upon such occasions (when I daily
            lost about four or five ounces of blood).</p>
            <p>It was <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie's</persName> opinion that I was deeply gone
            in a consumption and, if that continued, I should
            be barren, having my blood and spirits gone,</p>
         <p> which things was considered by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>
            and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs>. They were resolved from <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie's</persName> advice
            and opinion to look the best help that could be.
            Blessed be the Lord God of mercy which caused my
            friends to have pity on me and to seek for help.</p>
            <p>This was pitched upon: that I should go to
               <placeName ref="place:Scar_046">Scarborough Spa</placeName> for the cure of that sad distemper.
               And, accordingly, I went with <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and stayed
               about a month there until I recovered some strength.</p>
            <p>In which time, by the infinite and wonderful
            mercies of the Lord and his blessing upon drinking of 
               the waters, I recovered my strength by degrees.
            After the curing of me of that infirmity of bleeding, it, to a wonder, left me within two days and I was
            totally cured of it, and in that months' time was also
               cured of all my faintings and weakness (which did so

            at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> to see how she had disposed of her
            estate. Though what she had of her widowed estate
            at <placeName ref="place:Hips_099">Hipswell</placeName> was very fair — but nothing to his
            which he enjoyed of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> and in
            <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> — yet he was in expectancy to have
            got all her personal estate she left, and not satisfied with the £4000 a year left him
            by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> but aimed to have got that of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">his

            and affection, she had bestowed upon me (as she is
            pleased to mention in her deeds and will, with a singular
            character of my duty and obedience to her as well as
            on her deathbed, which is great matter of comfort to me:
            to have the testimony of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">so pious and holy a parent</rs>
            being the motive to induce her to dispose of her
            estate towards my relief and <rs type="group" ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1">my children's</rs>).</p>
         <p>
            After he had caused the court to be searched for
            probate of wills at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> — I, being then removed
            to <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName> — he told me that he had made a search
            at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> where the wills are proved and there was
            no will on the file, and the men of the court said they
            never saw any. And, if so, he believed <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> did
            make no will or disposal of her estate, it did all 
            fall upon him as her heir.</p>
         <p>
            This did much surprise me to hear <rs ref="ppl:cw2" type="person">my only brother</rs>,
            formerly pretended so great an affection to me, now
            to seek to defraud me of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> blessing, et cetera.</p>
         <p>
            I told him that though he was now the heir, as being a
            son, yet I was two years elder by my birth and, though he had
            got the birth right, yet I ought to have a share of her
            blessing if she had not made a will. But God be praised,
            she had made one in perfect form and manner and deed,

            by which she disposed all as she thought fit, and
            the will was at London long since and proved fully,
            and he might repair to it, if he pleased, and be satisfied.</p>
         <p>
            He did not believe me then, but since that did
            find the will on the file and so received satisfaction

          <p>Upon which, he slept three hours very finely and quiet.
            When he wakened, his face was all over full of

many sad thoughts of God's afflicting hand on

            <persName ref="ppl:atc1">My dear Nally</persName> came to me then, being about

            the rest they shot off muskets and had soldiers and the

          <p>But before two hours, they returned with <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs>,

or guns or drums, or noises and shoutings, she was
             so extremely scared at these things, and when
            the muskets went off so fast did so affright
             her and terrify <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my poor child</rs> that she was
             ready to fly out of <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower's</persName> arms (her maid). </p>
          <p>
             And, being almost out of her poor wit,
            did skrike and cry so extremely she could not be
            pacified for all they could do. But, in extremity,
            
            
            fell into most dreadful fits of convulsions there,

            having had three or four of them, so sadly and

            her alive, or bring her to herself again, but started
            extremely much and then falling down again.</p>

            At last, they — doing all could do to her — did

         <p>
            But I gave her all medicines for it, and oil
            of amber and peony and other things which, by the Lord's

            child and full of mettle, being much stronger

            had either rickets nor convulsion fits to keep 
            her down, but always continued very healthful
            and strong, and full of tricks and, indeed, apt to fall into

            to get it out but, with all the force I had, it pleased God
            to strengthen me to do it. I got beyond the pin and so
            got it out of her throat, but in a great deal of danger:
            her life was well-nigh gone and she was as black as cold.

            I began a most dangerous sickness which brought
            me to death's door at <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName>; after <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear

         <p>
            But this distemper came most violently
            upon me on <date when-custom="1661-02-13" datingMethod="#JulianMar">Tuesday the 13th of February 1661</date>,
            at which time I began with extreme vomiting
            and pains in my head and back and knees (and,
            indeed, all over my body) in great extremities,
            so that it continued in this manner, with burnings
            and fiery drought (and vomiting all that ever I took for
            any manner of sustenance for five or six days before
            <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">the doctor</rs> was sent for) until my mass of blood was
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-194"/>





         

         all infected with that dreadful fever which came
            upon me. And none did hope for this poor life to
            have continued, so that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
            did send for <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName> to me (I, being in so
            desperate a condition).</p>
         <p>
            When <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">the doctor</rs> came, I was almost spent
            and weakened beyond measure by the violence
            of the fever and extreme pains and grievous vomitings; all I took, without sleep, ease or any
            mitigation of the hand of God upon me.</p>
         <p>
            <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">
               The doctor</rs> was extreme angry that he was
            not sent for sooner until I was at the last cast.
            All he could do would not stay the vomiting
            though the fever was somewhat abated, I bless
            God, upon letting blood which I much desired.</p>
         <p>
            But, being so far gone, and the fever was a
            putrid, corrupted fever — having not had the
            benefit of nature by siege of eight days,
            and those natural way also for two months
            or thereabouts — my blood was in a great distemper  and out of order.</p>
         <p>
            <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">
               The doctor</rs> did confidently assure me that
            I was conceived with child but could not be
            able to go on. He doubted but should miscarry
            because of my vomiting all foods and medicines,
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-195"/>





         

         which did strain all the ligaments of my body
            and made it impossible I should retain the conception.
            Nor did any manner of food stay with me, until I
            told <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">the doctor</rs> that I did extremely thirst after some
            cold water, which he gave me and did more refresh my
            thirsty soul than all which art could give.</p>
         <p>
            That night, being the <date when-custom="1662-02-17">17th of February</date>, I did verily
            believe should be my last in this world, being reduced
            
            into such feebleness and weakness of body and spirits.</p>
         <p>
            But, most of all, cast into a spiritual desertion
            from God (which was not to be endured without sinking
            under it by the divine pressures of his displeasure)
            which I apprehended, in this my weakness, my eternal
            state to be in a lost condition by reason of my sins
            and the suggestion of Satan (accusing me falsely
            from my sorrows and temporal afflictions, and casting
            multitude of doubtings into my heart).</p>
         <p>
            As that, surely I did not belong to God and that I
            was not his servant because he followed me with such
            great crosses and afflictions
             — sickness and loss of children,
            friends and estate, suits and vexations from friends — <quote xml:id="q-349" type="allusion" source="#_Hebrews_12:6">and
            which seemed to be curses rather than such trials which

         <p>
            And that I <quote source="#BCP,_Holy_Communion,_Exhortation_to_the_Negligent" xml:id="q-350" type="allusion">had neglected those offers and tenders of

            and his ministers, and his deliverances, checks and calls
            of his spirit with all those spiritual and temporal
            advantages I have had and now want, and had
            no opportunity of receiving the Sacrament
            (being taken from me). All these I did receive
            
             before
            wonderfully, with deliverances of all   
             kinds,
            yet did they not work a thorough conversion
            and change of heart in me to walk according to
            the motions of God's spirit with that strictness of
            I ought to have done.</p>

            And that now it was too late to repent

            so long that my life was at an end; for ought I
            knew, this was my last summons. And that though
            God was able to have mercy on me, yet I had so
            often broke my promises and forgetfulness of God
            that he would not have mercy on me at the

         <p>
            In this most dolorous condition, I continued
            all that night and not hope or expect relief from my
            great unworthiness and ingratitude, expressing
            this — my lamentable condition — in pathetic groans
            which is more fully enlarged in my 'First Book' (in
               pages 189, 190, 191, 192, 193).</p>
         <p>
            Until, when I was almost breathless in my
            soul and got no mercy, nor durst not pray for it,
            <quote xml:id="q-352" type="paraphrase" source="#BCP_Psalter_Psalm132:7">yet I cast myself down at the footstool of

         <p>
            It pleased him in a most wonderful and gracious
            manner, when I was out of all hopes by reason of the
            strong temptations and my weakness, to bring me a
            speedy help and make me obtain mercy and comfort
            from that most sweet and blessed portion of holy
            scripture, which my dear Lord and saviour spake to

            In the midst of my distress of mind in my
            late great sickness, and I saw no hopes of my recovery, </p>
         <p>
             one great ingredient of my sorrow was for
            the uncertainty I should leave <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my poor daughters</rs>
            in, being but young children then, in regard
            of any settled fortune or provision was then
            left to provide either for their maintenance 
            or portion.</p>
          <p>Because the estate of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName>, which
            had been settled for their provision by articles
             made before marriage, was forced by <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr
                Nettleton's</persName> debt, for which, upon the assignment
             of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Mr Norton</persName> to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, he had secured
             to <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> out of his own land. And as I have
             related before, I was compelled — to preserve <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            husband</rs> from prison — to cut off that entail
            and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did engage before <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName>
            to settle provisions for my younger children
             (instead of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> was sold for this debt)</p>
         <p> to settle provisions for portions and maintenance for them out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>. I not having
            more alive but these two children, <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Alice</persName> and
            <persName ref="ppl:ktp1">Katherine</persName>, which was yet unprovided for at this
            time of my sickness.</p>
         <p>
            The consideration of this — that I might die
            in this sickness before anything done for them
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-207"/>





         

         by way of provision instead of what was so
            settled for them before marriage, and that it was very
            probable <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> might marry again and
            then the estate would wholly devolve from my heirs and
             
            
            these my children of my body — was very afflicting
            to my thoughts. And did much press upon me to
            take some advice what to do in this case to have
            some provision made for these my dear, poor,
            young infants, not able to take care for themselves , or <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">the child yet unborn</rs>,
            
             nor had I any relation or friend near
            me to take the matter into their cognisance.<anchor xml:id="ev161-end" type="event"/></p>

            At length, it did, by God's mercy, come into
            my mind to acquaint <persName ref="ppl:rl2">my cousin Legard</persName> (then
            at <persName ref="ppl:hc1">Sir Henry Cholmley's</persName>, <placeName ref="place:Oswa_141">the Grange</placeName>) being a lawyer,
            
            
            he, I desired to read my writings and settlements
            of the whole estate (both as to articles and then
            deeds which ought to have been made punctually
            by them) and to give me his opinion of them, </p>
         <p>
             whether or not <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had power to
            cut off the entail from my children or not.

            In regard that, when I was at <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName> <persName ref="ppl:awn1">my
               aunt Norton</persName> desired if I had a son, being then
            with child, it might be called Charles, it bringing his
            name with him and coming at so happy a time as at
            the restoration of <rs type="person">the king</rs> and the church.</p>
         <p>
            But <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would not consent to that,
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-208"/>





         

            to have him called Charles, for reasons best known
          to himself. But told me if I would have him
            called Charles, if it were a son, he should not
            heir any of his land, not a foot of his land,</p>
         <p>
            which did a little trouble me. But said that
            I prayed God to send me well over that condition
            and give him a son, and he might call him what he
            would. And so, God blessing me with <persName ref="ppl:wt2">a son</persName>, he had
            him called after his own name (though I told
            him, if he pleased, not to cross the names of
            his pedigree which had for so many hundred
            years gone in William and Robert).</p>
         <p>
            Yet, this circumstance of his saying, 'if it
            was called Charles, it should not inherit his
            land', put me in mind — in my sickness — that
            he had power to do it and made me to search
            more into the business. For, if I should now
            have had a son, yet it was not secure for
            that, but he might possibly have been cut
            off for a second venture (having power so to do).<anchor xml:id="ev163-end" type="event"/></p>

         <p>
            And, upon reading of the writings, he
            found that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had power by those

            been (either
            
            by <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> or myself) consented to.
         </p>
         <p>
            But by this accident was discovered, so that

            then his lawful heirs, that he would make
            some assurance of provision for them for a
            portion. And then, afterwards, if it pleased
            God I should live and have son to settle the land
            according to articles of marriage.</p>
         <p>
            To which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> consented and

         There was a paper draft drawn by <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr
            Legard</persName> of settlement of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> afterward
            (when we were at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>) and sent by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            from <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> which he did give me to read.
            But it was not drawn according to the
            articles of marriage.</p>
          <p>Videlicet. Settled upon my heirs males and, for
             want of such issue, upon my heirs female.</p>
          <p>But first, upon my heirs males and, for
             want of such issue, to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> heirs
             males upon any other wife, as may more appear.
               
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Which paper book
             
            I read, and I did not
            consent unto it (being destructive to the
            heirs of my own body) and desired <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            husband</rs> to be more kind to my lawful
            issue, who had brought him a plentiful
            
            fortune, nor could any blame the bowels of
            a mother to grant her own issue to be cut
            out of what they were born to.</p>
         <p>
            I know <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my poor husband</rs> was advised
            to this way to preserve his name but, if God
            had denied sons by me, it was not convenient to make heirs where God would have
            none. As <persName ref="ppl:rl1">my godfather, Parson Lascelles</persName>, told
            <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs>, when he was going to entail his
            land of some affair of my
               
             kin and disinherit

         <rs type="group">his daughters</rs> for where God will have a 
            family to continue in the name, he can give them
            sons and not for us to appoint who we will.</p>
         <p>
            So, this affair of making a deed of settlement
            of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was deferred until after I came to my
            house at <placeName ref="place:East_019">East Newton</placeName>, which I must speak further
            of, in its due place.<anchor xml:id="ev164-end" type="event"/></p>

         This <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan Robinson</persName> was a servant which
            I had brought from <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName>
            with me and to whom, as being a servant
             for
            work, I was very kind, as indeed I find myself desirous to be grateful when they deserve
            it (without a boast) for I am glad to meet with any
            who would encourage me by their duty.</p>
          <p>She, living with me in <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt's</rs> house
             at <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName>, fell in love with one of her men,
             <persName ref="ppl:nf1">Normavill Fisher</persName>, who was a foolish, young
             boy of 18, but this <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> had so great folly
            that she was bewitched with <rs ref="ppl:nf1" type="person">his person</rs>. </p>
         <p>
             Though he was one that was a bastard and had
            gotten one (as we heard) himself and, therefore, no
            way was he a fit husband for her.</p>
         <p>
            <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower</persName> and I, out of our love to <rs ref="ppl:ar1" type="person">this woman</rs>,
            did often advise her against him — because
            he was not suitable for her and had no means
            to keep her on — but <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> was so ill displeased
            and angry (secretly, as she confessed to me after)
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-213"/>





         
            
            
         
         at <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower</persName> and myself that she was resolved
            to be revenged of us both for speaking to advise
            her against <persName ref="ppl:nf1">this Fisher</persName>.</p>
          
          <p>
    
         
            But this was not discovered until she had
            done us a very wicked displeasure to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
               husband's</rs> brother, <persName ref="ppl:tt1">Mr Thomas Thornton</persName>,
            who was a very humorous man and had not
            so good a nature as the rest of my brothers and
             sisters (though he was a very honest, plain man).</p>
         <p>
            It happened that, as my custom was, I did
            invite my brothers and sisters to dine with us on
            a Sunday, but he turned away and would not
            speak to me; at which I wondered, he not doing
            so to me before but was always kind and
            civil to me who, he said, was the best sister he had.</p>
         <p>
            At evening, after prayers, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and myself went down to see my brothers and sisters,
            where we found them altogether sitting at door.</p>
         <p>
            I gave them the usual civility, and they all did
            return it again but <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother, Thomas</persName>. I asked
            him, 'Brother, I would have been glad to have
            had your company to dinner today, why would
            you not come?' To which he answered, very doggedly
            and surlily, and said I did not mean as I spake
            and was but a hypocrite. At which, I told him he did
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-214"/>





         

me much wrong. For I had always the
            desire to speak as I meant, and wondered he
            should say such a thing of me that I did not
            deserve. Upon which, he flung away in a
            great anger against me.</p>
          <p>
            I could not but be extremely grieved and
            moved at his ill carriage towards me and
            fell into a great passion of weeping to find
            myself so highly affronted by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>
            <rs ref="ppl:tt1" type="person">brother</rs>. And went into the garden to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, </p>
         <p>
             making my complaint to himself and
            <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, and related the same thing
            of <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother, Thomas</persName>, with great concern for what I
            had ever done or said anything
             to offend him at any time.
         </p>
         <p>
            They both did pray me not to 
            be so troubled
            at him; for he was <rs ref="ppl:tt1" type="person">a very humorous man</rs>
            at all his friends, and never was friends with
            them altogether, and I must not be so sore troubled.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            I said I was sure some had been telling of
            lies to him and prayed <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> to
            get it out of him and, if I had really done him
            any injury — which I knew of none — I would
            satisfy him and, if not, he must not continue
            so displeased without a cause.</p>
          <p>After which, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> examined him
             and found he had been told that I said, 'I 
            had rather have a Scot in <placeName ref="place:Scot_095">Scotland</placeName> have the
             estate than him',
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-215"/>





         

which words I did utterly deny; for I never
             thought such a thing in my heart, nor could I
             speak it with my mouth but on the contrary (if
             anything were said) and that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> knows.</p>
          <p>For when, at any time, <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother Thomas</persName> had been
             drinking and tippling, as he was used (God knows)
             too often to do, it did so much grieve <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            husband</rs> that one time said to me,</p>
          <p> 'Here is this <persName ref="ppl:tt1">brother, Thomas</persName>, doth so grieve
             me and trouble me, with his idle course of life and
             drinking, that he shall never heir any
             land of mine. And I will cut him off and
             give it to <persName ref="ppl:jd3">Jackey Denton</persName>, <rs ref="ppl:etd1" type="person">my sister's</rs> son'.
            </p>
          <p>
            At which, I answered, '<persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, oh, dear
            heart, do not so; for he is <persName ref="ppl:tt1">your own brother</persName>
            and, though he be not so good as you would have
            him, he is your next heir after your children. </p>
         <p>
            And God may give him children that may
            be good, for I have seldom seen an estate to
            prosper when the right heirs are cut off'.</p>
         <p>
            And this, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> did affirm I said
            and desired <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> to get it out of him
            who did tell him that lie of me. Whereupon, he
            examined him again and, with much ado, got it
            out of <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother, Thomas</persName>, who did affirm that
            <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan Robinson</persName> told him, before she went away.

            A long story of my maid, <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower</persName>, and
            myself. Videlicet.</p>
         <p>
            That, one day, I was at <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName>, and
            (as she said, was not well and she was combing
            my head) that <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> should say to me, 'Now,
            if you should die, God help these <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">two children of
               yours</rs>, for <persName ref="ppl:tt1">Mr Thomas</persName> would wrong them of
            the estate', which, <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> said, <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> did repeat
            twice or thrice before I spoke to answer her.</p>
          <p>And, at length, when she had spoke so oft
             to me, <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> said, I answered her that I had
            rather a Scot in <placeName ref="place:Scot_095">Scotland</placeName> should have it
             than <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother Thomas</persName>, which he believed I did
             say because <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> told him she heard it,</p>
          <p> but she charged him not to tell who told
            him.</p>
         <p>
            After <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> rehearsed this
            to me, before <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, he said he believed
            she was a great liar for I would not say such
            a word. And I did positively deny the whole
            thing: that <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> never said so to me, nor I to her, and
            I would have it searched out the truth of it.</p>
         
          <p>
    
         
            After a little while, <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> was to go to <placeName ref="place:Nort_101">Allerton</placeName>
            to see <rs type="person">her father</rs> and <rs type="person">mother</rs>, and I bid her to go
            see <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan Robinson</persName> at <placeName ref="place:Scru_113">Scruton</placeName> (within a little of
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-217"/>





         

            <placeName ref="place:Nort_101">Allerton</placeName>) and to charge her to tell the truth
            and I would forgive her (if she did tell <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother</persName>
            that story) upon her repentance for such a great
            lie she told of us both. But, if she did not confess it, she might never expect any kindness
            from me or her.</p>
         <p>
            <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> did as I had ordered her and took her aside, and betwixt them two, told her to that effect, but
            first asked if she remembered she had ever heard
            such words passed at any time betwixt her <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">mistress</rs>
            and herself. To which <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> did protest and swear that
            she never had in all her life heard any such thing.</p>
          <p>Then, she again charged her with telling <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my
             brother, Thomas</persName>, that story. To which, with cursed execrations, she denied utterly and said, would she be
            such a beast as to make such a lie of me who had
             saved her life often and had been a mother to her?
            She would be hanged before she would do such a
            wicked thing, so that <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> did believe her.</p>
         <p>And came and told me all this discourse betwixt
            them, and I related it to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, and he did
            tell my <persName ref="ppl:tt1">brother, Thomas</persName>, that <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> denied all and said she did
            never tell him such things of us.</p>
          <p>Upon which, <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother, Thomas</persName>, did protest
             and vow that she did tell him every word, as he was a 
             Christian, so that I was assured <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan</persName> had made
             that lie of us.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-218"/>





         

          <p>The occasion of her going away, as she
             pretended, was to recruit her strength after
             a dreadful fit of the running gout, which it
            pleased God to lay upon her after she had
            thus wronged me and <rs ref="ppl:jf2" type="person">my maid</rs>.</p>
         <p>
            She had the most grievous torments and
            pains in extremity, all over her joints and
            limbs, and swelling all over them; the pain
            first coming from one hand and fingers and
            from the other, and from one foot and leg to the other
            in a day's time or at nights.</p>
         <p>Which followed so thick upon her that
            she took no rest or sleep, or scarce any meat,
            which we were all in a great confusion for her.
            And I knew not anything too good for her, and did
            watch myself and servants and had others to help
            night and day with her, and used all the means
            and doctor for her I could get. (And her shoutings
            so great and loud that we was forced to lie at
            <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton's</persName> and could not sleep for her
            in our own house.)</p>
          <p>After a month's time, and all the means I could
             possibly use to recover her, she was restored and
            free from those pains and was in a very good
             way of mends. But, she had sent for <rs type="person">her mother</rs>,
            who came and would needs have her home
             (it being agreed betwixt them) and procured a
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-219"/>





         

             horse-litter to carry her easily, and paid all costs
            and charges of her sickness and all things besides her
             wages all that time and those to do her work, above £5<am>l</am>.
         </p>
          <p>Now, while she was with me, <persName ref="ppl:rw2">Robert Webster</persName>
             (<persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> man) was very fond of her and
             would have had her to his wife. And we all did
             counsel her to forsake <persName ref="ppl:nf1">Normavill Fisher</persName>, that
             never looked at her, and to have <persName ref="ppl:rw2">Robin Webster</persName>.</p>
         <p>
            And I was so kind to her that I told her,
            before <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two children</rs>, that if she
            minded what I should say, I would offer her a 
            kindness if she accepted of it that she should
            never have again if she refused.</p>
         <p>
            That because <persName ref="ppl:rw2">Robin Webster</persName> loved her and did
            dote so much on her, he would make her a better
            husband than <persName ref="ppl:nf1">the other</persName>. And, if she could love
            him, I would desire <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> to build up the  warrenwarant 
            house
             at <placeName ref="place:East_141">Newton</placeName> and they should live in it and
            pay rent, and he might do service to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            as he had which would do him and her good.</p>
         <p>
            Upon which she thanked me for my kind offer
            but she would never love <rs ref="ppl:rw2" type="person">that man</rs> as long as
            she lived, and that she hated him as ill as a todd or
            the devil and wished she might never prosper if
            she had him, and would be drawn in pieces with wild
            horses before she would have him and such like curses.
         </p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-220"/>





         

          <p>Upon which, I bid her hold her tongue for
             a wicked woman that cursed herself so. For
            it would light on her for her wickedness
             and as a curse to her, God would make her
             to be as mad on him as ever any was, and her
            evil would lighton because God sees all her
            ways and words.</p>
          <p>And bid her take notice that what I, in
             kindness, had wished her to and, about building the warren house, I would not do it
             for her (she, having denied my kindness).</p>
          <p>So that, I believe, she had a design to go
             home to see if she could get <rs ref="ppl:nf1" type="person">the other man</rs>,
            and when she came home found he was
            married to <rs type="person">another woman</rs>.</p>
          <p>And after this intrigue was over, and her
             desires crossed of this fellow, she cast about
             in her mind how to lay hold on <persName ref="ppl:rw2">Robert Webster</persName>,
             being advised by her friends perhaps. (He
            having a great deal of money gotten in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
             service while he was a justice of peace.)</p>
          <p>So, it was concluded she could not get
             him because he had never gone to see her, being
             advised against it by his best friends (she
            being a woman given to drink and that not fit
             to make a wife of, nor indeed did I know of that
             quality until too late to retrieve myself).</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-221"/>





         

         <p>It was advised she should get into my service
            again, which would compass the business for her.
            So, she got <rs type="person">their minister</rs> (which I knew) to write a
            most excellent submissive, humble letter with all
            the fair words of gratitude for what I had done and that
            she begged she might be entertained as my servant.</p>
          <p>When I got this letter, I writ word that, before
            she could expect I would entertain her
             again, I would be satisfied of things where
             she had done me wrong. Upon which, she comes
             to <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName> and, in a most fearful trembling,
             she came into my chamber. I asked her, with a
             troubled heart and charged her home, what that
             lie she told <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother,Thomas</persName>, and whether she had ever
             heard <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> and I to speak anything to that purpose.
            
            
             She fell down, amazed, at my chair and said, no,
             she did not, as she hoped to be saved.</p>
         <p>
            I, then, with much grief, told her what made
            her to make such abominable lies to make
            <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> <rs ref="ppl:tt1" type="person">brother</rs> to hate me: how durst
            she do it? To which, she said, with many tears and seeming
            sorrow, that it was the devil that bid her do it
            because she did it to be revenged of <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName> and myself for persuading her for her good against
            <persName ref="ppl:nf1">Normavill Fisher</persName>. Thus, was the free and true confession
            of <rs ref="ppl:ar1" type="person">this wretched, vile creature</rs> to clear me of that lie
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-222"/>





         

         which she had invented to be revenged
            of us for our good will to her. And so, when I
            had reproved her severely and caused her to confess it to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:tt1">brother Thomas Thornton</persName>,
            I was so much a fool that — upon her repentance —
            I entertained her again, which act of pity
            I did hoping she would have had more
            grace never to do the like and after my
            saviour's command: if thy brother sin against
            thee and repent, thou shall forgive him. But the
            good Lord, my God, knoweth what an ill
            instrument of hell this has been to me in a more
            bloody and cruel manner to do wickedly
            against me, and sinning against God and her
            own conscience and betraying my innocent
            soul by her pernicious slanders.</p>
          <p>But the Lord, my gracious <quote source="#BCP,_The_Litany" xml:id="q-392" type="phrase">Father of heaven</quote>,
             has brought it upon her own head, and made
            her to confess her own guilt and wickedness
             before <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and <rs type="group">my children</rs>, and to do
             me that right to say, it was the devil that put
             it upon her again.<anchor xml:id="ev166-end" type="event"/></p>
          
          <p>So that he is the father of lies, and of him <rs ref="ppl:ar1" type="person">this

            After which of our coming to <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">the house</rs>, within a little
            time, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my dear husband</persName> was called to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> about
             that unfortunate business of <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr Nettleton</persName>, as before related. He, going purposely for that affair to prevent
            the breaking up of an execution against him by <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr
               Nettleton</persName>, for a debt which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had secured out of

             (As more at large may appear in my 'First Book' in
   pages 194, 195, 196, with all circumstances about this affair.)</p>
         <p>
            But, before I came from <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName>, having
            fears upon me that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> might have some
            false dealing done to him — and that there was but
            100<am>d</am> betwixt them — I did desire him to take it up and
            pay him, rather than have suits run on and prosecuted 
            
            to the far end.</p>
         <p>
            But <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would not do it, but thought to have
            got better of him and made him refund £100<am>l</am>. I did
            also offer to procure as much for him (having as
            much of my own, which <persName ref="ppl:aow1">my dear mother</persName> gave me) but
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> hoped to save it and so went to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>
            on purpose to prevent the breaking up the execution.<anchor xml:id="ev172a-end" type="event"/></p>

            But he prosecuted him with all the rigour could be, and
            false dealing and treachery, against <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>. And,
            most unjustly and spitefully, watched an opportunity when

            got an execution broken up (against body, lands
            and goods, having entered into a statute to him) </p>
         <p>
             and one morning, very early, came with his own
               man and four other bailiffs to seize upon all the goods, plate,
            monies, whatever else we had in the world, until they
            were all paid their demand and satisfied their debt, et cetera.</p>

            At first, the men was very rude and violent: I
            feared they would have seized upon my person (then
            big with child) but they frighted me very sore.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-232"/>





         

         <p>
            But behold the great goodness of my gracious
            Father in heaven, who had provided some of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
               husband's</rs> friends. <persName ref="ppl:jd2">My good brother Denton</persName>, who with
            his prudence did mitigate their fury, and although they
            demanded at first the whole sum of £800<am>l</am> to be
            forthwith paid to them (for which the statute
               
            
            was entered).
         </p>
         <p>
            But he, knowing the debt was all paid, only part 
            of it in dispute, prevailed with them to take the
            sum of £200<am>l</am>,
             which they
             would have paid or else to
             seize on all the plate and what I had in the house,
            and all quick goods, horses and all else, et cetera.</p>
         <p>
            I confess this accident was very afflicting to me,
            both in regard it was a debt of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> and ought
            to have been paid out of his estate (and would have been
            so had not <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> been ill advised — and wronged in it — to
            secure it out of his own, contrary to reason or need for 
            there was £2000
             a year to pay it out of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> land
            
            in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>).</p>
         <p>
            And besides it was a great disparagement that
            when we were new come into <placeName ref="place:East_019">the house</placeName> — where we
            were to live in reputation as family, and I brought
            a good fortune to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and clear as any was
            by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">father</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> — yet such a misfortune to happen
            to entertain my first coming into the <placeName ref="place:Ryed_129">world</placeName> was
            very unhappy and uncomfortable to me.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-233"/>





         
            
          
         <p>
            Besides, the great and suddenness of the terror and affright
            this action brought me into in my condition (having
            but lately escaped death and miscarriage so nearly two times)
            
            
            and this fright, joined with a hearty grief, did bring me
            very low again and I expected nothing but a sudden
            abortion and destruction of <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my poor infant</rs> in my
            womb. It had been happy if <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
            would have hearkened to my kind and affectionate
            advice to have agreed with <persName ref="ppl:rn1">his adversary</persName>: he had
            gone to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> and he should freely have had my own
            money (that <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> had given me to furnish
            my house) and have prevented all this mischief that
            befell to me and might have done worse.<anchor xml:id="ev172b-end" type="event"/></p>
       
          <p>
            But still, in all accidents, whatever befalls me
            in this or other concerns of my life, the Lord, my 
            God, who is my only life and support, preserver and deliverer  doth still show his most gracious, and mighty

             and appointed a relief at hand for me to prevent

            In the first place, I am to consider with humble
            gratitude to his majesty that, though it was but in
            a dream, he gave me so much warning of this
            evil to happen upon me, which did prepare me with
            more patience for this accident which was to come on
            me that day. By which means I was not so extreme, suddenly surprised as otherwise I should have
            been which might have, without it, been fatal to us
            both (mother and <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">the child</rs>).
         </p>
            
         <p>
            For that very morning, before the bailiffs came,
            I dreamed for a certain that <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> had sent
            his bailiffs to drive all our goods and to seize on all
            we had for that debt which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> engaged.</p>
         <p>
            And I was in deep concern as soon as I
            wakened out of sleep after it, but case that he
            should send to distrain upon me in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
            absence, what could I do in it and how could
            I be preserved? It might not be impossible, I thought,
            such a thing should (though he went up to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>
            to hinder it) but, however, I was glad that he was not
            at home though they would be rude with all.</p>
          <p>When I was in these thoughts in my mind, at
             that very tonune of time, came my maid <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane
            Flower</persName> to my chamber door and unlocked it very softly
             and came so to the bedside, and — with a soft voice, for fear
             of frighting me out of my sleep if she spoke suddenly — </p>
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-235"/>





         
          <p>
             spoke softly to me, 'Forsooth, are you awake or a sleep?'
             I immediately answered her, '<persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane</persName>, I am awake but,
             pray answer me truly to what I ask you. is <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton's</persName>
             bailiffs here?' At which she was surprised, and said, 'Has
             anybody been here with you today, to tell you so?' I said,
             'No, nobody. Did you not lock me in? </p>
          <p>
              But tell me truly, are they not below?' To which she said,
            'Yes, indeed', they were below, 'but how, in God's name, did
            you know?' I said, 'None but my God gave me warning in
            a dream, which I had dreamt this morning'. She prayed me,
            for God's sake, not to be afraid, for they should not come
            to me, and they would take what care they could to make
            them quit (for there was <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:fd3">Mr Darley</persName> with them).</p>
          
         <p>
            So, I blessed God for giving me this notice beforehand,
            which did me much good and prevented the extremity of
            the fright to fall on my poor spirits,<anchor xml:id="ev173-end" type="event"/> though with much grief
            that fall on me and fright too; <milestone xml:id="ev174-start" unit="event"/>for the rudeness of those men
             and considering the injustice and unhandsomeness of that concern
            that came suddenly on me in that business.</p>
          <p>
    
         
            Yet, behold, and see the good providence of God still
            to take care of me that I should not be hurt or too much
            
            disgraced in <rs type="place" ref="place:Ryed_129">this country</rs>, being a stranger, but had so
            ordered it that there was £100<am>l</am> of my portion newly

            and paid back again) which £100<am>l</am>,
             together with £57<am>l</am> of my
            own which <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my blessed mother</rs> had given me by <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> before
            her death.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-236"/>





         

         <p>
            which did at present satisfy them (upon <persName ref="ppl:fd3">my uncle
            Francis Darley's</persName> promise to make it up £200<am>l</am> or else
            their fury would not have been stopped without a further
            mischief and taken my poor bed, and <rs type="group">my children's</rs>, with what
            we had given by her for our relief).<anchor xml:id="ev174-end" type="event"/></p>

            Thus was the exceeding mercy and goodness of the

         <p> it was matter of some comfort to me that

            Who, in his absence, made their several visits

            It pleased God to continue my health and

            (sickness, dangers and ill accidents) and to make me
            draw near to the time of my delivery,</p>

            a mother of a family, to take more near care
            of them (who, for aught I know, I might leave
            behind me in this world) and therefore, ought,
            as much as in me laid, to have them provided
            for according to the true intent of all parties
            agreed upon before that consent of marriage

         <p>
            These was to be the rule for us to proceed by

            But that

            liberty to be left to cut off the entail from my

            Which power I knew not of until that passage

            and to get — for that present necessity — that bond of

            it was still my great business to endeavour to obtain
            that the estate should be settled as at the first intended.
            And it was my desire to <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName>, he would draw

            male or female, without power to cut it off (only
            in regard that <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> was sold and the money
            disposed of, as before mentioned. Videlicet. To pay <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr
               Nettleton</persName> £1000 or those of which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had
            borrowed money to pay him with at <placeName ref="place:Hull_027">Hull</placeName>, <persName ref="ppl:xs8">Mr Skinner</persName>).</p>
          <p>And the other £1000 to purchase the rentcharge
             of <persName ref="ppl:rc1">Ralph Crathorne</persName> of £80<am>l</am> per annum, out of which <rs type="group">his brothers</rs>
            and <rs type="group">sisters</rs> was paid the interest of their portions
            (as <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> told me).</p>
         <p>
            And that my £1500 out of <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> was all
            disposed of, and nothing left from debts to be for
            all the younger children that I should have.</p>
         <p>
            Whereby they, and my heir too, was left at an
            uncertainty by the paper draft sent from
            <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> by <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName>. Though I had prayed him to
             get done with some provisions for maintenance
            and portions for them to be set out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> (as
            it had been before out of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> settled before
            marriage for them) and because I could not yield
            to pass a fine before <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did solemnly
            promise to make some provision for them out of 
            
            <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, nor to cut my children quit out of all,
            I thought it a very hard thing to do to them without it.
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-241"/>





         

          
         Though I did my best endeavours to leave all things
            in the best state I could and secured to them the estate
            by this means, as I hoped by <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName> to have
            done without any further trouble to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and
            myself.</p>
         <p>
            Yet, when I perused <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard's</persName> paper draft —
            which I had entrusted him to draw up according to
            these articles and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> promise to me before 
            <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName> for the entail and provision of children —
            I found his letter, received from <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName> (dated
            <date when-custom="1662-06-18">June 18th, 1662</date>) and the paper draft, drawn far
            contrary either as to the settlements themselves (for
            my jointure out of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>) or <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>; both the
            uses quite different and contrary to my directions, and
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> articles and promises to me. So that I
            was in a very great concern for it, and told <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
            Thornton</persName> that I desired to be better satisfied before 
            the writings were drawn.<anchor xml:id="ev178-end" type="event"/></p>
          
          <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev180-start" unit="event"/>
         
            Upon which, I was 
            forced to send to <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName>, counsellor,
            which had been made use of many times in case of
            his opinion (concerning all those things in question
            betwixt <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>) who set
            things aright for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and ordered those affairs.</p>
          <p><persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName>, in his letter of <date when-custom="1662-08-22">August 22, 1662</date>, when I writ to
            him and sent my writings and the paper draft of <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName>
             to consult with him, delivered his opinion candidly of
            those concerns and did find the paper draft not to answer those settlements and entails as ought to be done,
             and promised to come over  to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and do all things to both
             our satisfactions. But, in regard I have been so much 
             condemned for this deed, which was made by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName>,
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-242"/>





         

         it will not be amiss to vindicate the alteration of
             the first jointure deed (made by <persName ref="ppl:rb1">Sir Robert Barwick</persName>)
             contrary to the true intent of the marriage articles.
            And also to vindicate my cause and reasons not
            to have the settlements of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
             to pass according to <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard's</persName> paper book
             (which he, in his letter of <date when-custom="1662-06-18">June 18, 1662</date>, sent with it, by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            from <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>, when he should have stopped <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName>
             from breaking up the execution and against him).</p>
          
          
          
          <p>Therefore, I judge it necessary to insert the
             original letter of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill</persName> about it.</p>
          
      
       
         
         
                      
         <p>Dear <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">cousin</rs>,</p>
            <p>I have seriously perused all the writings you sent me,
            and I perceive that the intent of the articles made upon marriage (albeit, it be not therein so fully expressed as might have been) was to entail the
            manor of <placeName ref="place:East_019">East Newton</placeName> on yourself and your issues
            begotten by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my cousin Thornton</persName>. The jointure deed
            is not made pursuant to the intent of the articles
               and by that deed, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my cousin Thornton</persName>, after your decease,
            might have barred the entail and cut out all your
            issues from any benefit by that deed, which he and you
               now have done by your late  fine passing, so that
            I conceive that deed is out of doors.
         </p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-243"/>





         
         
            <p>As for your paper draft and new intended settlement;
               I like it better than the first deed, but yet the provisos
               therein mentioned do trouble it. The first proviso,
               folio 17, doth alter the intent of the articles; for, by
               it, your daughters (in case you have not any son) may
               be deprived of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> upon payment of £3000 to them. But by the second proviso,
               folio 19, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my cousin Thornton</persName> hath power (after your
               decease) to make a jointure of all <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, or of
            any part thereof, to any second wife or wives which
               he shall marry after your death, which may prove very
               prejudicial to your children. There being then,
            no present provision at all upon any of your
            issues but left at liberty to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my cousin</rs> to dispose
               of as he pleaseth (as you may see, folio 12).</p>
         <p>
            The second proviso, for making of a jointure
            to a second wife, I like the worst of  any part of the
            intended settlement. For by the first proviso, which you
            scruple at, a son by a second venture cannot have
            <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> but upon his payment of £3000
             to your daughters
            and, until then, the estate will remain in your daughters',
            so that he cannot defeat it but by payment of the
            money. One thing your paper draft wants, which is
            in your jointure deed, and that is provision for your
            relief out of the lands in <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> for what lands
            shall be evicted from you in <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, but I hope there
            need no fear of this. I intend, God willing, to set
            forward towards <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> <date when-custom="1662-09-01">the first of September</date> and shall
            reason the case with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my cousin Thornton</persName> about the paper book
            and your doubts, and hope to give satisfaction to you both.
         </p>
          
        
        
         
        
          
          
        <p>
    
         
            Thus far concerns this business as to the settlement,
            intended to be done for my better security or for my children's,
            which I had no cause to like; it being so far from mending
            as it quite destroyed the entail and deprived my issue of
            their birthright, and to do it to other purposes.</p>
          <p>To which intent, it seems, I was advised to pass a fine
             of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> which utterly destroyed it and of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> too.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-244"/>





         

         <p>
            Pretence by <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName> to have settled it firmer
            on my issues than <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was done by the
            first jointure deed. Indeed, this was a great 
            fallacy showed to me by him whom I relied upon
            for true and faithful dealing. And, it seems, that
            great straits I was put upon (in my distress, in
            my sickness) to have somewhat settled for my children
            at present if I had died (a bond of £6000 to give
            them) was made use of as a snare to cut them
            and all my issues from their inheritance which deed
            I would not have done for the world. But the fine I passed
            made me fear some worse thing, after I saw the
            paper book.</p>
          
          
          <p>
    
         
            But, by the good providence of my gracious
            God upon me, I had so much notion of the
            thing that I could not be satisfied until I had
            <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill's</persName> advice and assistance to
            the drawing of the settlements (both of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and
            <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>) more to my satisfaction and security of
            my children's inheritance and provisions.</p>
          <p>But, in regard <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts was very
            high and that would be more speedily paid than
             could be raised out of the land, I was (upon <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
            Thornton's</persName> desire and upon condition that the younger
             children should not be totally left unprovided for)</p>
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-245"/>





         
          <p>
              willing that my £1000 portion — which was to
             be out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> by my father's will and to have been
             laid out in land for me as an addition to my jointure,
            and appears by articles of marriage and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> bond to
             secure the same for my use —</p>
         <p> 
             I say to show my love to the whole family, I was
            content to let it go to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> use to pay his debts,
            whereby the estate might be cleared and my younger
            children to have a certainty settled for them out 
            of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, according to his engagement before the
            judge, <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName>: on which terms I yielded to
            pass a fine on <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> which was settled for that
            purpose before marriage.</p>
         <p>
            After which agreement, the settlement of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>
            and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was made with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> full 
            consent, who both nominated the portions and main 
            tenancy which they were to have out of the land
            (which, considering my own fortune, was not to
            be judged so high when there was but £1500 betwixt
            <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">the two daughters</rs>, if no more of them, but if any
            more younger children then their shares to be less).
            However, the land was entailed, by this settlement
            of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">cousin Covill</persName>, upon my issues (both of <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>
            and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>) without power of cutting it off from them
            or defalcation, which was not so done by either of the
            other deeds as was intended by articles of marriage.</p>
         <p>
            But now, it was a matter of great trouble to 
            me (that by reason of these unhappy and unfortunate
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-246"/>





         

            debts of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and his sad engagements,
            all his estate was so involved and burdened) that
            the first provisions of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> being gone from
            them and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> forced to be charged with it
            which, if it should please God to give me a son,
            was entailed on him by the articles first made.</p>
         <p>But things being so sadly cross on <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            and myself that all my fortune did 
            
            
            little
            
            good to
            us or
            our children, but fixed for debts and <rs type="group">my
            brothers' and sisters'</rs> portions. There was no visible
            allowance or provision for a son, if I had one,
            which did extremely concern me for it and
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> also, but it could be no way
            helped and leave anything certain (my portion    
            gone). 
         </p>
         <p>
            But I did at that time promise to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            that — if in case God should please to leave me and
            call for him first — that I would by God's grace
            (if he gave me a son to live) that I would be
            a kind mother to him and give him the best
            education and maintenance I could (considering
            my low estate and the debts, and to leave myself
            anything to subsist on for the love I bear to
            himself and family).</p>
          <p>And, if pleased God to take me first out of
             this world, I hoped he would be a kind father
             to my son (if I left one behind me) and take care
            of him
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-247"/>





         
            
            
         
             When this business of settlement was in doing, I was
             willing to pay all charges belonging to fees and clerks,
             and counsel, and did (out of my own purse that <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear
                mother</rs> had given me) pay <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill's</persName> charges and fees and
            gratuity which might cost me about 
            
            
            
            £20<am>l</am>
            
            
            .	
         </p>
          <p>One thing I had forgotten to mention I was willing —
             out of my great love to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and his family —
             to do, and deprive myself of that privilege I had
             (by my first deed of jointure) to have it with power
            
            
            and without
            
            
             impeachment of any manner of waste, by which
            I might have had the privilege of cutting down the
             wood, et cetera. But I did desire only to leave myself liberty
             for all manner of uses of ploughbote, stileboot, housebout,
             firebote and what I needed, being so desirous to preserve
            the same to posterity. This was no act of unkindness
             to all the family, when I did forgo so great a privilege,
            as well as to give up all my portion by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> and
             many hundreds of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs>, which she gave me for my own
             uses and necessities which I was daily put to.

    <milestone xml:id="ev183-start" unit="event"/>
         
            While this affair was in acting, one day was going down the stairs to the parlour with bottles of ale, et cetera,
            to entertain the company there, my hands being
            full, there was <persName ref="ppl:cd1">Celia Danby</persName> (here with her mother, <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs
               Danby</persName>), <persName ref="ppl:cd4">my nephew Christopher's</persName> daughter  — a child of
            four years old — when she was going down before me, tumbled
            down a great part of the stairs and fell desperately on her
            head. At which I was much frighted and, in making
            haste to save her, I got a very desperate fall down four
            stairs with my knees, which did shake and bruise me much, and
            had like to bring me to my labour before my time.<anchor xml:id="ev183-end" type="event"/></p>

            Insomuch that he was forced to borrow great sums
            to discharge those suits and engagements, as may appear

            both in statutes staple, and of a dangerous consequence

            But, as to <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr Robert Nettleton</persName>, his statute was not delivered up nor all discharged, but he continued very
            stubborn and demanded more than <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did

           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> carrying me to <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName> to see our 
            
            
            friends in the assize week: I, knowing no other
            business I had there, one morning, being in
            bed with him, he began to be very melancholy troubled.
            I, asking him how he did and what ailed him? Was
            he not well? On which, he said he was much troubled
            at a business which was like to befall him presently
            if I did not help him out of it.</p>
            <p>
            I told him, he knew — <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">dear heart</rs> — I had never
            denied anything within my power to do him good.
            He said, I must go before <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName> with him
            this morning. I asked him, for what? I had nothing
            to do with him, on which he told me:</p>
            <p> that, that unfortunate business of the assignment
            of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton</persName>, had compelled him to enter into
            a statute to secure <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton's</persName> debt, which he would have
            done out of his own estate and not out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>,
            and now he prosecuted him with such rigour that, if he

did not pay him this sizes, he would have him to the
            jail. I told him, being surprised at this sad news
            for my breakfast, 'Alas, he could not compel you to
            have done it out of your own, there being so great <placeName ref="place:Cast_085">an
               estate out of Ireland</placeName> out of which it must be paid'
            (and myself and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> had begged him not to meddle
            with that assignment because of the trouble of it).</p>
         <p>
            He said, he was sorry for it but could not now
            help it, and he must go to prison if I would not
            bring him out of those straits by passing a fine of
            <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> (which he had bond money on of <persName ref="ppl:cf2">Mr
            Foxley</persName> of <placeName ref="place:Hull_027">Hull</placeName> and had sold him that estate to
            pay <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName>). And, if I would not consent to join
            in a fine before <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName> that day, he saw no
            way but to go to jail for <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> debt.<anchor xml:id="ev184a-end" type="event"/></p>
            
            <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev185a-start" unit="event"/>
            This speech did much terrify me, to be so suddenly surprised and of so sad a nature; being great with
               child, I fell into a great sorrow for it,</p>
         <p>both for the misfortune of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and
            the affliction of myself, and the dishonour of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
            dear father's</rs> debt to fall upon us. And that by his own
            act and deed: he not being compelled to it in law or equity.</p>
         <p>But the great concern was to me: I must
            either yield to destroy my children or <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>.
            For if that land was sold, there was none to make
            it out of for any provisions for my younger children
            but <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, which was for a provision for my heirs
            if I had one, and if I did not do this rash act, I
            might have <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> in prison for <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father's</rs>
            debt. So, I said, I was in a great strait what to do and
            why would he not be so kind to tell me before I came?
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-252"/>





         

            He said, he durst not, for it would not been granted
            to by <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>. I said, she would have helped him
            with some money to have satisfied <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> but
            she knows nothing. I was in a great consternation
            at this sad news, and so suddenly taken, and begged
            of God to help me out of this trouble and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>.</p>
         <p>
            So, I told him, 'Dear heart, if I did yield
            for your sake to pass this fine, what will become of
            all my younger children?' (having three then for maintenance
            and portions for them). For that he did assure me,
            if I would for his sake yield to do this thing
            for him and deliver him out of this great danger,
            he would take it for the kindest part I could do
            and faithfully did assure and engage to me that
            he would provide for his younger children's
            maintenance and portions for them, out of his
            land of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, of £100<am>l</am>
             per annum.
         </p>
         <p>
            Upon which consideration and faithful promise
               
            
            
            to me he would do so — and give the rest of the
            lands in <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> to his son's maintenance, if
            he had any, as heir that he might be provided for
            too — provided he would perform this promise, I
            would be content to pay a fine, though it would go
            very hard with me to have his land pay <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs>
            debts secured by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> deeds and will.
         </p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-253"/>





         
            
         
         <p>
            But he said, he questioned not to have it paid him
            by <persName ref="ppl:cw2">my brother, Christopher Wandesford</persName>, out of that estate afterwards
            which, I bless God, afterwards he did (by the agreement
            
            
            of <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName> when <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> delivered up the estate to him).</p>
         <p>
            So, thus was I compelled, with a sad heart, to
            yield to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> desire and so he carried me before
            him that day, who took me aside and questioned
            my willingness to pass a fine of this estate.</p>
            <p> I answered my Lord that, indeed, it was a surprise
            to me that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> should have occasion
             to sell
               his land, having had a considerable portion with me and that it was all I had settled for
            provisions for younger children. But <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
               husband</rs>, I trusted, was an honest man and he
               would perform his promise: who did promise to
            me he would settle as good an estate out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
               (as £100<am>l</am> per annum for their maintenance and portions)
               and the rest to be for my heir, if I had any. And upon
               those conditions, I shall be more willing: being
            in a great strait what to do and would show my love
            to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>.</p>
         <p>
            Upon which, <rs ref="ppl:xt7" type="person">my 
               Lord</rs> said, '<persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, I find <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">your
            wife</rs> is a kind wife to you. And she saith this estate
            is all the provision for her younger children and,
            if you will settle as good one out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> as this
            of £100<am>l</am> a year and the rest for her heir, she is willing.
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-254"/>





         

         I cannot blame her to take care for all her children
       . Are you willing to settle an estate accordingly as
            you promised her?' Upon which, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did
            very solemnly profess and promise and engage himself to do so, and settle the same estate out of
            <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, 'and this, I promise before <rs type="person">your lordship</rs>'.
         </p>
         <p>
            Then said <rs ref="ppl:xt7" type="person">my Lord</rs>, 'I find <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">your wife</rs> is a kind
            wife to you, and a kind mother to take care
            for her children: see
               
            that you do so as you engaged'.
            Upon which, he said he would by God's help, and
            upon which consideration and conditions the fine
            was passed by me and on no other conditions.<anchor xml:id="ev185a-end" type="event"/></p>
            
            <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev186-start" unit="event"/>
         
            But this settlement was never made or
            done all this time, and made me concerned for it
            in my sickness at <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName>; nor anything in lieu of it
            remaining, that estate — as <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName> said — in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
               Thornton's</persName> power to evict them and all my issues,
            which was so considered (then in my extremity) to
            get that bond of £6000
            to secure £3000 to the only issue
            I had alive <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">(two daughters</rs> for the present, until it
            pleased God I should recover of that great
               
             sickness
            and brought out <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my son</rs> at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> afterwards).
            But I judged it not safe to let the settlements go
               undone, until I was delivered,<anchor xml:id="ev186-end" type="event"/> <milestone xml:id="evn11-start" unit="event" corresp="awt1_1662_settlement_fears"/>and so <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName> drew that,

            as I have observed before, and related and the reasons

            better for them to have been paid in money of mine).</p>
         <p>Nor could this settlements of the whole estate
            be gotten done until about a month before my being
            delivered of <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son Thornton</persName>, which I was very

            live to see it done before I thought I should have
            died. And <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill</persName> did assure me that
            he had drawn the settlements so well and
            firm that it could not possibly be cut off
            except I should give my consent to it, which he
            did give me a strict charge that I should not
            consent to the ruin of my children. To which,
            I promised I never would do by God's help.
            He said, if I did, I should never get them so
            done again.<anchor xml:id="evn11-end" type="event"/></p>

            But several years after <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Harry Best</persName> (who
            had married <persName ref="ppl:kdb1">my niece, Katherine Danby</persName>) came
            to me in a very sifting way, about that time when
           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> borrowed
               
            
            the £100<am>l</am> of horse race money
            (though I knew not of it then).</p>
         <p>
            And told me that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">his uncle Thornton</persName> had need
            of money, and that he desired me that I would do
            as much as yield to cut off some of the land of
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-256"/>





         

         <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, if I would not cut off the entail
            of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill</persName>. I told him, I was very sorry that
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had need of any more money — for debt;
            having given all my English portion and
            also my £1000 out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, I gave for debts
            on purpose to clear his estate and that <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
            might remain entire for his children by me — 
            and so desired to satisfy <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> in it.</p>
         <p>
            But he, pressing me to this, and he, being a
            trustee nominated in that deed of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">cousin Covill's</persName>,
            I thought to have his advice about it
            whether it were not drawn so firm that
            it could not be cut off without my consent.</p>
         <p>And so very innocently showed him that
            deed which, when he had read it, he did tell
            me that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> could cut off the entail without my consent. And charged me by no
            means to let him see it, nor know of it;
            for, if he did, he would certainly do it of
             himself without my consent and then it
            would be worse for me and my children.</p>
            <p>I told him, 'If it were so, I am sure it was
            not done wilfully by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">cousin Covill</persName> because he knew
               the ill consequence of such a thing', and said, 'I would
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-257"/>





         

         not be so ill a person as to destroy that deed which I got
               done so hardly for my children because of the debts'.</p>
         <p>
            But begged of him, <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName>, as he was a friend to
            myself and children — having none of my own relations
            to stand for me, but him and he, being a trustee in that
            deed — so he would not discover that which he said
            he found out to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, whereby that entail
            might be cut off and settled for other uses.</p>
         <p>Upon which words, he did promise and faithfully
            engage to me upon his faith that he would not
            betray my cause to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, nor discover the failing in that
            settlement; on which promise, I relied, nor did think
            that he would have done so treacherously to me
            as it did prove afterwards.</p>
            <p>For I was told by <rs type="person">a good friend</rs>, after all was
               done, that <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName>, immediately after he had discovered this thing, he went to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and
            told him that it was in his power to cut off the
            entail of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName> without my consent.
            And did put him into a way to do it and showed
            him that the fault was in the contingencies which <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill</persName> knew
               not. But, by his leave, <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill</persName> did know the contingency
            that the portions should not be paid but in case of
               my death, as it was so ordered to befriend <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-258"/>





         

               or his second marriage, that <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">these two children</rs> (I,
               then had) might not be defrauded of both the
               inheritance and birthright, as it was intended by
            <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Legard's</persName> deed, but only to have a certainty out
               of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> secured for them, which was redeemable by
               either <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">their father</rs> paying £1500, or by their brother
               (if they had one) who had <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> secured to him
               by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> entail and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, too, after the
               payment of his sisters' portions, it was to be freed.</p>
            <p>And I do say, it was <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> himself —
               and of his own motion and goodwill — which did appoint
               to them this sum of £1500 to them, saying that
            it was but reasonable they should have so
            much, because I had put it to him what he would
            please to allow them and said he had got a very
            considerable fortune with me, by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> and
            <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs>, and they should have so much.</p>
            <p>And this, and more to that purpose, I heard him
               speak in the little parlour before <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName> and many
               more present. Therefore, if he knew what reason
            he had and did it himself, none need to lay it on
               me that it was my act to overcharge his estate,
            when I was like to be burdened myself by parting
            with all my fortune from all my children for debts and to
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-259"/>





         

free his estate, and himself, of that trouble. And
               was willing to do more than that: to take on me the
               education of my son, if I had any to live.</p>
         <p>
            
            The relation I have made of <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best's</persName> kindness
            to me, or rather his hard dealing and treachery,
            which betrayed <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">his friend</rs> and forfeited his faith, I had
            not suspected in the least but by the sad consequence
            which followed upon it as to the cutting off the entail.<anchor xml:id="ev187-end" type="event"/></p>

            And not only in that point was cruel to myself
            and poor children, for whom I entrusted him,
            
            but showed itself in point of drawing up of
            the writings and settlement, which I got him to make
            for my poor children of the disposing of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear
            mother's</rs> goods and monies and personal estate, which
            she — by her last will and testament — gave me for my
            life and to dispose of at my death to my children 
            as I should see cause and best deserving.</p>
         <p>
            She made her deed so warily (perceiving
            that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> estate was so deeply dipped in
            debt that if she had not so disposed them to be free
            of that, I nor mine would not have been better for what she
            gave us) but took care we should have the use for
            our conveniency in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> life and mine, but not to be wronged of them
            or charged by any debts, whatever, for which I bless God.
         </p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-260"/>





         

         <p>
            But I, upon my disposal of them 
            by deed according
            to her will, desired <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName> to make the deed
            after the same manner as <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> dispose.</p>
         <p>
            Yet, contrarily to that, neither as a true friend
            to me or my children, he drew those writings,
            which I was to sign, in such a manner as to
            make all her personal estate (given to my poor
            children and myself) to be liable to pay the debts
            and to be seized upon for them at present.</p>
            <p>Which thing, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did declare to me
            he did not know nor had a hand in it and was
            not pleased with it; so that I never would seal
               the same, although they cost me a great deal of
            charges to draw and engross for fees, and to him and
            <rs type="person">his clerk</rs> which was done at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>.
            <anchor xml:id="evn12-end" type="event"/>
            </p>
            
         <p>
            Thus, I have daily cause to see, there is no
            trust in man but may fail me. And I have had
            great experience of man's treachery, but of my
            gracious
             God and merciful Father's great power
            and compassion towards me in all the great concerns of my life, I have infinitely great cause
            to praise, and bless and glorify his most holy name which
            has still discovered, and prevented, the ruin of myself
            and children. Oh, that we may walk answerably to all
            these, his favours, and put my trust always in him forever.</p>

            First: that dreadful one, of my sickness at

            The second: through grief at a strange accident
            that happened me, when I was pretty big of him of a
            fright which came on me by a surprise of the sight
            of a penknife which was nigh to have hurt one.
            The fear and dread apprehension thereof did 
            cause a mark of a deep, bloody colour upon
            <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">the child's</rs> heart, most pure and distinct and of
            several shapes, continuing so as nothing could
            wash them off:  —1 — the first appearance like a stab
            or cut with a penknife, with many pure, distinct
            drops of blood all about it, as if one should
            have sprinkled little drops with their hand on it.</p>
          <p>The second form it came into the direct form of
             a 'T', with the like drops about it of pure blood.</p>
          <p>The third form it came into was exactly

            begged of the Lord that he would be gracious to

             to remove this great mark upon <rs type="person">the child</rs>.</p>
          
          <p>After which, it pleased God that the colour did
             fade by degrees, and grew paler and, bluish and
             about a year or near it, they was quite gone.

continued, by fits, a wearisome time all that
            week, being very big and heavy with my burden).
             On <date when-custom="1662-09-18">Thursday</date>, my <persName ref="ppl:kc1">lady Cholmley</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:awn1">my dear

            I began to be extreme ill all that night and next day
            but, because I did not quicken speedily (which I could
            not do, he being so great <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">a child</rs>) and <persName ref="ppl:etd1">my sister

            <rs type="group">my sisters</rs> did go home about four o'clock, thinking

          <p>But, within two hours, my extremity began and I fell
             into excessive torments and racks and, by my

             assist me, but they did not believe her, but that I

             to assist in my great extremity, so that I was near

            it pleased God further to exercise me, his

            beginning a little after <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my child</rs> was born

         <p> I fell into a most desperate extremity of

            it was terrible to behold of them was about
            me, bringing me into a most desperate condition,
            without all hopes of life: spirits, soul, strength

            redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
         <p>
            But in the distraction of my friends for me, that none
            knew what to do to preserve my poor life even then in
            all apprehension passing from me, my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName>, out
            of her fright, came to my bedside and wept over me. And
            said, '<rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">My dear cousin</rs>, you that helps everyone to save
            them, cannot you tell me what would do you good in this

            God to enable me, the laying her ear to my mouth, to say only, 'Go
            into closet. Right-hand shelf box. Powder. Syrup of cloves, give
            me'. And by divine providence, she got that box and powder,

            <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName> had made for provisions for my children's
            maintenance and portions (which was to take place if
            either my death or <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> happened that they
            might not be left desolate of provisions for their
            subsistence, et cetera) that I, not suspecting any treachery
            from him, a trustee and <rs ref="ppl:kdb1" type="person">my own niece's</rs> <rs type="person" ref="ppl:hb1">husband</rs>, had
            (as I related before) let him see the writing and deed of
            settlement to give his cordial advice to me of it.
            And he pretended to find a flaw in it and promised to
            conceal and not to discover it to my own or my
            children's prejudice.</p>
         <p>
            Yet, did he immediately go to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            and told him he had seen the deed, and that he had
            power to cut it off, alone, without my consent
            and so ordered the matter that (by his advice,
            I suppose) persuaded <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> to do it, to make
            a new deed first, wherein he gave livery and seisin
            to <persName ref="ppl:fd3">Mr Francis Darley</persName> (as is mentioned) by which he did
            make himself to make a new deed and cut off the
            former entail, and make a new settlement of the whole
            estate of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> to the prejudice and almost ruin

            it, until the year <date when-custom="1666">1666</date> which, by providence, I came to see.
            And the very grief I apprehended was so great at
            that time, on the discovery to me, that it did force me to that
            miscarriage which I had and long continued sickness by the excess of floods (which lasted a long time on me and mentioned in my 'First Book', page 216).<anchor xml:id="ev202-end" type="event"/></p>

         <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev203-start" unit="event"/>
        As I remember, this new deed, which was made instead of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> settlement was (by its date) made
           at <placeName ref="place:Stea_052">Stearsby</placeName> or then about (<date when-custom="1665-11-16">November 16, 1665</date>) in which
            <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was divided in two parts, and the whole
            was charged with a mortgage of 99 years for a
           debt to <persName ref="ppl:tp1">Mr Portington</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:xr1">Mr Raines</persName> of £1400.
           And until all and every part of that debt — with full interest —
            were paid, no other use or uses could be paid out
             of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>; as may at large appear, by the
            said mortgages being paid into them by me and my
           moneys out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> since <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
           decease (which debt was also secured to them
            by rentcharges out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> by <persName ref="ppl:an1">Mr Anthony
               Norton</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, his executor: they receiving the
           moneys as we got it out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>). </p>
        <p>But this mortgage, being first over all that estate
           of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, what could be fixed for my children's
            livelihood or secured for them?</p>
        <p>Moreover, the deed was ordered so as but on
            moiety was for their provision; being first charged
           with maintenance and portions for a second wife's child,
            and the other part for a jointure for a second wife
            to go out of it for her provision.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-277"/>





         

         <p>As also power to charge this estate with <persName ref="ppl:hc1">Sir Henry
            
            Cholmley's</persName> debts, as I have mentioned before.</p>
         <p>
            From whence could any of this estate at <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
            be able to afford anything for the relief of any of
            my children: neither heir nor younger children
            could ever get one penny to subsist on. Where,
            then, was the pretence by <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName> that I need not
            take such care for settlement for my children
            when it was better done for them than by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill's</persName>
            deed? It may be judged by any indifferent person
            that I could not be able to go out of this world
            with a quiet conscience to leave the children of my
            body thus forlorn, and contrary to all agreements
            made before and after marriage for mine.</p>
         <p>There was likewise a provision in this deed
            which never was in any before, nor ever entered it into
            my friend's intentions or <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>.</p>
         <p>
            Videlicet. That in case <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> should die
            without any heirs male of his body by me and that his
            daughters (heirs female) should have the land of
            <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> that they should pay unto <rs type="group">the brothers
               and sisters</rs> of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> the sum of £1500
            amongst them, which sum was so great that it
            was above the purchase of the land. And they had been
            better without the land than buy it at so high a price.</p>
        <p>After the discovery of this deed which, by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr

          After the drinking of <placeName ref="place:Scar_046">Scarborough</placeName> waters,
             not then mistrusting myself to have been conceived,
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> sent for me to <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName> about some
            business with my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName>.
             My uncle, <persName ref="ppl:fd3">Francis Darley</persName>, was in company with me
             and <persName ref="ppl:cd4">my nephew, Kitt Danby</persName>. I was very faint in the
            morning and eat nothing before I went and the water
             wrought with riding. I told <persName ref="ppl:cd4">Kitt Danby</persName>, I was
            sick and faint and would have lighted to refresh myself a little at <placeName ref="place:Stre_118">Strensall</placeName>.</p>
          <p>But <persName ref="ppl:fd3">uncle Darley</persName> would not grant it. Said we
            should be soon at <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName> and so I did not take any
            refreshment for displeasing of him, which indeed <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my
            dear husband</persName> was sorry for and would have had
             me done. This did somewhat disorder me then, but
            I got home pretty well,<anchor xml:id="ev204-end" type="event"/> <milestone xml:id="ev204a-start" unit="event"/>but that which was most
            hurt to me was the news of the cutting off the last
             deed of settlement by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName> from my children,
            which struck me into a sudden grief when I was told
             how it was and what the consequence was of it.
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-279"/>





         

             Upon which my grief and concern was so great —
            which I had upon the notice of this action to be
            passed and no certain provision out of all
            my own fortune or <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> whole
            estate — that I fell into a sad trembling and
             shaking of an ague and, as I walked with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my
                brother Denton</persName> in the hall and discoursed of this,
            I found myself extremely ill in my body
            as well as mind. And so proceeded to great
            extremity of those which broke suddenly
            on me and began to be violent and weakened me
            so greatly that I could not expect but
             my death should proceed. And, though <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName>
             was called to use his best art and skill,
            yet such was my inward grief and affliction
            for this unkind part towards me and the 
            children of my womb that I could take no
             ease and rest, joining with my daily expectation
             of death. And that again aggravated by the 
            knowing there was nothing fixed for none
             of my children, neither son nor daughters,
            and that my cutting myself and mine of the
             benefit of my £1000 out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, (to pay
             debts and to purchase for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two daughters</rs> I had,

             each of them, £800<am>l</am> portion and some fixed
             maintenance for them) that — being now by
            this cutting off this deed by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
            act — I had no hopes ever to have  them
            maintained or to be provided for. And
             also, foreseeing my own approach of death,
             had not one faithful friend (since <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr
               Best</persName> betrayed me) that I could leave matters
            
            with all <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my three poor children</rs> which tormented
            me most of all, assuring myself that this
            provision for a second
             wife was done to no end.
            
         </p>
         <p>
            Nor was I so desirous to live in this
            sad world of deceit had it not been in
            regard of my poor children: to have
            left them as beggars instead of provision
            to have kept them like children of ours and
            not as bastards which I saw nothing done for
            them. The full relation of my sad condition,
            the meditations thereupon, and the present
            cure my gracious God and <quote source="#_2Corinthians_1:3 #BCP,_Prayer_for_Persons_Troubled_in_Mind" xml:id="q-422" type="phrase">Father of mercies</quote>

            But since I have, for my own vindication,
            been forced to make several discourses of my
            unfortunate falling under the <quote xml:id="q-423" type="phrase" source="#_Job_5:21">scourge of the
            tongue</quote> by slanders and lies, I am, moreover,
            obliged to make some more observations
            to make apparent my clearness and innocency , and why I was wronged in this
            manner, even for the discharge of my duty
            which lay upon me by the provision for my poor
            children. For, after I was restored to
            life again in this miraculous manner — as
            the hemmorist was in the gospel and that day
            this history was read in my chamber of our
            saviour's cure done upon that poor woman —
            he gave me grace to believe in him and to lay hold
            on him by faith that he was as well able to
            cure me as he did that poor woman (St Mathew 9: 
            21-22. <quote xml:id="q-424" type="direct" source="#KJV_Matthew_9:21">If I may but touch his garment I shall
            be made whole</quote>) and, so, I was, from that same hour,
            which infinite mercy I have and must acknowledge
            to his great glory, all the days of my life. Amen.

            poor children, and so I was set on work

         <p>
            And when <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> did go to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>,

            me with matter and would have persuaded me
            that the last deed was done well enough as
            <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName> told him. But I was much dissatisfied
            and until I saw it, which I obtained by <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>
            (who I begged that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would please to let him
            show it to me, being then big <rs type="person" ref="ppl:ct1">with child</rs>, and
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-283"/>





         
            
            
         
         desired to go out of the world with a quiet
            mind if it were done for my children's good).
            At last, I got the sight to read it over by myself, when I was in a greater consternation
            than before to see that so great alterations was
            in it. As first, only one half of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> settled
            for my children's portions and maintenance, and
            that a lease of 99 years to take place before
            to secure <persName ref="ppl:tp1">Mr Portington</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:xr1">Mr Raines</persName> (for which I
            had parted with my £1000 in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> to pay them).</p>
         <p>
            And next, that a settlement was made for
            a second wife's jointure and for provision for
            a second wife's children, and all to be before one
            penny to be paid for my poor dear children —
            none of them — until these was satisfied.
            Then, in case that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> died without issue
            male, that my daughters was heirs they
            should pay out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, the sum of £1500
            out of the land. All which was so great a grief
            to me that I was not able to bear it.</p>
          <anchor xml:id="evn13-end" type="event"/>
         <p>
          <milestone xml:id="ev205-start" unit="event"/>
            But having considered this matter, and that
            I was near my delivery, I had none to apply
            for redress to have this altered. And did show
            this deed to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, who judged the case was
            very hard and gave me his best assistance.
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-284"/>





         

         
            
            
         And I was forced to send him to several
            counsellors to have their opinions in the case,
            and had several journeys, and put me to great
            charges to have it right drawn, as it was
            done by the last deed made by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
            the year before he died.</p>
         <p>
            The constant trouble was much which I was
            forced to put upon myself and him — in perusing
            writings and other occasions accruing in that concern
            because the thing in itself would have looked
            strange to have acquainted my own relation
            with these things — made me do it in what secret
            manner I could, and only <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>,
            and myself and him was privy to it (besides <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
               Thornton</persName>, who was the party, and <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>).
            So that this might be occasion of those evil
            persons — that hated me and my children — to judge
            ill of the honestest actions in the world.
            For, while my sorrow was so great and expecting
            of my death shortly and would have had this
            business finished before I laid in of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">my last
               child</rs>, 
            <anchor xml:id="ev205-end" type="event"/>
            <milestone xml:id="ev206-start" unit="event"/>there happened also a proposal of marriage
            by <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> that he would 
            please to accept of him for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>,
            and if he pleased to grant that request, he would
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-285"/>





         

             think himself happy in such a wife,
            and would stay his leisureif it were seven years.</p>
         <p>
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> gave him many thanks
            for his respect to <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> but she was
            very young to marry, and he would not have
            him to hinder his good fortune but dispose
            of himself sooner than he could marry her.
            Upon which, <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> replied that he had a 
            greater honour for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Mrs Alice</persName> than anyone in
            the world and, if he pleased to consent, he would
            wait his own time, so he might but obtain
            that happiness at last.</p>
         <p>
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did give him thanks for his
            good opinion of her and said, if he would
            stay until her age to be disposed of, he might
            be as like to obtain, hoping that he would be
            a good and kind husband to her if she married.</p>
          <p>So, upon this hopes, <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> did solicit
            my consent, and I told him she was so young
            that he might have some other and would be more
             suitable (she being inexperienced and would
             be long before she was fit to be disposed).</p>
         <p>
            All these things was answered by his earnest
            desire and solicitation, and testimony of his great
            respect and affection, as witness his earnest letters,
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-286"/>





         

            he writ to her and myself in that concern.
            On the other side, I had encouragement to
            hope he would prove very good and to love
            her, and by God's grace might be happy for them
            both. Therefore, did not refuse this motion,
            being, I considered, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> 
            and myself was but in a weak condition
            (his palsy fits coming so often on him
            and my own uncertainty of outliving
            my childbearing). And now this late sad
            scene acted — in the unsettling this estate — 
            and feared the worst after my decease,
            if none of my children were not disposed
            or married before I died, so that I begged of my
            God to direct me in this great concern of
            my life that I might do nothing displeasing
            to his majesty, but that might have his blessing
            to go along with us.</p>
          <p>Besides, I found, if I left my children so
             young without a guide in their religion,
            which was my greatest fear, and God should
             take us both from them, I knew not what ill
            consequence that might be to them nor into
            what hands they might fall into.</p>
         <p><persName ref="ppl:rt2">
            My poor son, Robert</persName>, being but six years old,

         would want a guide to instruct him and to
            support him in his youth and education in the
            true faith and religion, with <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">his sisters</rs> which
            did not yet understand the profession of
            the Church of England; so that, having all
            these good motives, it did overbalance that
            objection of her friends who did say <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
            had no estate and it was an undervaluing.</p>
         <p>
            But, since my hopes was <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this gentleman</rs> would
            make so good a proof and was an excellent scholar
            hopeful to rise in the world by his own pains and
            industry for all these good ends, I did more incline to this motion. And hoped he might be a 
            stay and a succour to all my children when we
            were gone.<anchor xml:id="ev206-end" type="event"/> <milestone xml:id="ev207-start" unit="event"/>Therefore, was <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and myself
            very desirous to settle 
             him here in this living 
            (to have him settled in this living at <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName>)
            and we did both desire my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName>, my good
            uncle, to procure the perpetual advowson of the
            living of <rs ref="ppl:cs2" type="person">the king</rs> that we might have it annexed to his estate at <placeName ref="place:East_019">East Newton</placeName>.</p>
          <p>A benefit so great and desirable, in the consideration
             of this family, that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> endeavoured to get
             the same confirmed by the <persName ref="ppl:cs2">King Charles II</persName>,
            
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-288"/>





         

             which <persName ref="ppl:jf1">my dear lord</persName> did join with us in, and
            solicited that business so far until he writ me
             word, he had so good and kind a master of <rs ref="ppl:cs2" type="person">the
            king</rs> that he would deny him nothing in his
             power to grant. But my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">lord</persName> had taken advice
             in that thing and counsel told him, it was in
            <rs ref="ppl:cs2" type="person">the king's</rs> power to sell the advowson for his
             time but no more, it being annexed to the crown
             and could not be alienated. But, if <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
             would have it done, he could get it for £300<am>l</am>.
            When we heard that was no otherwise to be got
            but subject to a change upon the king, we did
            not prosecute that design anymore.</p>
          
          <p>
    
         
            But deemed it the best way to secure the present
            enjoyment for <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett's</persName> life and to take a
            lease for three years, wherein <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did
            much rejoice that it might be so well supplied
            as by <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>. So, upon <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett's</persName> coming
            over, he, with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, did treat with <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr
               Bennett</persName> who, before, was resolved to marry one of
            his daughters to <persName ref="ppl:xc3">Mr Culliss</persName> and, for her portion, to give
            her <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> living (having one at his own
            counting). And <rs ref="ppl:xb10" type="person">that man</rs> did so threaten the parish
            that he would only send a curate to read prayers
            
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-289"/>





         

         and give him £10 a year for it
            but not find a preaching minister, which did
            so grieve <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> that he said he
            would leave his house and live where he might
            have the word of God preached.</p>
         <p>
            After <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> came 
            to, terms was made
            betwixt them (<persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> being then at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>
            and knew nothing until afterwards). And so,
            <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> stuck upon the whole year's
            profit due at Whitsuntide then. And, unless
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would pay £100
            then, at entrance, he would not grant to
            terms, which <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> knew <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            husband</rs> would not grant nor indeed had
            it to pay. So that, on conditions the lease
            should be done and agreement made with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
            I was willing to pay that £100<am>d</am> to <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName>
            but <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> did not know of it (only
            I procured this money out of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear
               mother's</rs> land, which I let <persName ref="ppl:xb8">Butterfield</persName> have
            a lease of until it was run out and paid that
            money down to <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName>, <date when-custom="1666-06-25">June 25, 1666</date>).
            After which, the lease was done and he to have 100d
            a year out of the living; <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> farming 
            it of him for three years, and he to find a preaching
            minister.</p>
         
      <pb xml:id="page-290"/>





         

         <p>
            So, upon these terms, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            was very desirous to have <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> to 
            supply, that he might enjoy the living and
            what was to be made of it over and besides
            this £100<am>l</am> per annum. But, I fear, there was not
            much got out of it (besides for the officiating
            the cure) until <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> was persuaded
            to let <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> enjoy a lease of it for
            his life, which he did upon payment of some
            more rent which was not had out of either
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, or the living or <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>.
            But let that pass. What was done, was done
            with a sincere heart towards God and, in an
            and for, the best ends to be an establishment
            to the family in this true religion and faith
            of God and to provide a standing ministry
            also (in regard of the expectancy of the
            dispose of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my dear daughter, Alice</persName>, in marriage). In this way, I did endeavour to give
            <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this gentleman</rs> encouragement for his great
            pains he took in the family, in teaching
            and instructing and catechising all my children
            and servants at house and church.</p>
         <p>
            I did supply the want of his £40<am>l</am> a year,
            which <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> gave him for the cure,
             with as much
            out of my own land and gave him many
         
         
      <pb xml:id="page-291"/>





         

         other necessaries he wanted. And afterwards, we prevailed to get the living
            conferred by great solicitation, pains
            and cost by my dear <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville's</persName> good
            assistance. I procured the presentation
            for him after <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett's</persName> decease.</p>
            
          <p>
    
         
            Nevertheless, I did engage <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>,
            that whenever he should remove hence
            to some other preferment, that he
            should part with this living of <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName>
            to <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son, Robert Thornton</persName>, which would
            be an excellent advantage for his spiritual
            as temporal preferment.</p>
         <p>
            For, as I had begged him of God, so did
            I make it my utmost endeavours to
            have him fixed in so good a station as
            near his own place of birth and his forefathers.<anchor xml:id="ev207-end" type="event"/>  All things then, being acted for
            these holy, pious Christian ends and designs,
            I know not with what face the devil and
            his instruments could devise so many horrid
            lies of a poor creature that made it my
            business to bring up and maintain my children,
            and provide so happily for them all, as in this
            action — I hope, in God — has proved by the great
            mercies of my gracious God and for the good of
            many souls. So that I will rejoice in persecution
            and bless God for the good he has pleased to
            bring out of all my afflictions
            to my poor children.

            now dead and their lives cut off in these sins). 
            I will praise the name of the Lord forever
            and magnify him for his truth and goodness,

            which did not suffer <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> to
            have the least evil thought of me, his true
            servant, but the last journey he ever took
            was to be revenged of <persName ref="ppl:xt8">old Mr Tancred</persName>
            (whose malice was against me because I did
            get that mortgage cleared of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> for that
            £100<am>l</am> for <placeName ref="place:Hamb_020">Hambleton</placeName>, which he had got that land

            secured to him for it). So, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
            did intend to have questioned <rs ref="ppl:xt8" type="person">that
               villain</rs> for his wickedness against me, his
            innocent faithful wife, as he called me.<anchor xml:id="ev211-end" type="event"/>

            But, God knows, he, dear soul, had got
            cold in going to <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName> at that time,
            and he fell into his palsy fits of which the

            I left in a distracted condition by his
            death and more fit to die than live, though
            the Lord has done great things for me his
            desolate widow, and I will praise and glorify
            his name for evermore. Amen.</p>

            own account book; having disbursed many
            and constant sums for their maintenance
            and interest, and portions amounting to large
            sums (more than ever my children ever
