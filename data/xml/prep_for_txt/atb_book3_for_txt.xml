            in this darksome cell of earth.

         <l>Thou givest me time and power, and space to breathe</l>

         <l>To fit us for thy holy place to inherit.</l>
         <l>For which thy gracious goodness did design</l>
         <l>To us, poorest
            mortals, by thy love, divine.
         </l>
         <l>After a few days spent on earth in fear</l>
         <l>Of thee, our great creator, and sincere</l>
         <l>Obedience to thy just

          stand,

            I beseech thee, O Lord, to grant my poor request:

            Of this, my weary pilgrimage,

         <l>Our sins away, by precious death</l>
        <l>Of our dear saviour, which gave us breath.</l>
         <l>Purify our souls, refine our dross</l>

        <l>Oh, let me, thy handmaid, I thee humbly pray,</l>
         <l>Find so much favour that all debts may pay.</l>
         <l>Thy widow's oil, O Lord, do so increase</l>

        <l>Oh, let not my faith, my hope in thee to fail,</l>
         <l>Nor sin or Satan, the flesh or world prevail.
      </l>
        <l>But now, O Lord, accept the offerings of my humble
          heart,</l>
         <l>That I thy glorious mercies may impart</l>
         <l>Unto my children's children (may indeed)</l>
         <l>Which from thy handmaid did proceed;</l>
        <l>That to the glorious praises of thy name,</l>
         <l>I may set forth thy mighty fame</l>
         <l>To all the families of heaven and earth,</l>
         <l>To sing thy praise, while I have breath:</l>
        <l>Who, from the rising of the sun</l>
        <l>'Till it return where it begun,</l>
        <l>Is to be praised with great fame. Therefore, praise ye his</l>

           A Relation of Memorable Actions and Afflictions 
           Befallen to Me in the First Year of My Widowed 
           Condition since <date when-custom="1668-09-17">September 17, 1668</date>
              
         </head>

          <p>I, having now passed through the two stages of my life 
        of my virgin estate and that of the <quote xml:id="q-040" type="paraphrase" source="#_Hebrews_13:4">honourable estate 
            of marriage</quote> as St Paul terms it, though <quote xml:id="q-041" type="paraphrase" source="#_1Corinthians_7:28">with much troubles 
            in the flesh</quote>, the same has had its comforts allayed to me. </p>
         <p> <quote xml:id="q-042" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_116:12 #_Psalms_136:26">Yet have I great cause to render most humble thanks 
        to the great God of heaven for his infinite and inexpressible 
           favours towards me</quote>, <quote xml:id="q-043" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_1Corinthians_10:13">who has mixed his frowns with smiles; 
           his afflictions, with comforts and so ordered his visitations as 
        to make a way for me to escape</quote>. And bestowed on me that 
        great blessing, above many others, of a dear and pious, virtuous
        and chaste <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">husband</rs>, with whom I lived and enjoyed his 
        endeared and faithful affection in the bond of a holy marriage 
        without the least taint of our conjugal vow, but our faith
            
           and holy tie most sacredly and inviolably kept to each other
           (as I may justly avouch who am now left <quote xml:id="q-044" type="allusion" source="#KJV_1Timothy_5:5">the most desolate 
        and forlorn widow</quote> in the world by this separation of so dear <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">a 
          husband</rs>). But who may say to the Lord, 'what doest thou?', since 
           

               <quote xml:id="q-045" type="partial" source="#_Job_1:21">the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh: blessed be the name of the Lord</quote>.
         </p>

          <p>
            
           He pleased to lend me his life, though mixed comforts 
           with many tribulations of this temporal (evils falling upon our own 
           persons, posterity and estate, which made enjoyments bitter to us).
         </p>

         <p>
           Yet, while we enjoyed each other's love — and endeared, candid love — 
        so entirely to each other, with the benefit of Christian piety and religion, 
        it did sweeten our temporal troubles to us and made us value
             this 
           world but as a troublesome passage into a better. And God thereby 
           these, his dispensations, so wisely framed and moulded us in the <quote xml:id="q-046" type="phrase" source="#_Isaiah_48:10">furnace 
        of afflictions</quote>, drew our hearts to him and there fixed <quote xml:id="q-047" type="paraphrase" source="#_Hebrews_6:19">our anchor of 
           hope</quote> that, after this miserable life ended, we shall enjoy each other 
           in a glorious eternity. And often would <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my blessed husband</rs> say, 
           'My dear, oh, that thee and I, and all our dear children were now all with 
        God'. Nor could I be blamed to wish the same and pray for it, if it 
        might be good in the sight of our gracious Father in heaven who
           made and preserved us to this time of our days. And, I hoped, in his 


        <pb xml:id="page-023"/>






           due time — after a few days here spent in his service and doing 
        his work which he has appointed us to do — we shall enjoy the same.
           </p>
        <p>
        
          But, as to the set time of our departure, we dare not appoint it
        
              to him but submissively wait his divine pleasure, both when and the 
               circumstance of our abode and of our work, and also endeavour to be ready
          for him at his call.
         </p>

          <p>

              Often would <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> give a check to my great 
              and unreasonable desire and passion of grief for him, when I have
              been ready to die with grief for fear of losing <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my chiefest joy</rs> by his 
           death, gently reproving my too much doting on him,


               </p>

         <p>
        
           told me: I loved him more than I ought; should love no 
           creature so but God; wishing me to submit to his pleasure and part 
        freely with him to God if he called for him. For he prayed that I might 
        be preserved and spared for his children's good, and that I might do them more 
        good than he could do, and hoped I might outlive him and be a comfort
        
           to them. Yet, I was not of that opinion or desire but begged rather
            to go before him.
         </p>

          <p>
           But that God, <quote xml:id="q-048" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_Job_34:13">the wise disposer of all</quote>, so ordered in his pleasure to
            continue me yet in the <quote xml:id="q-049" type="phrase" source="#_Psalms_116:9">land of the living</quote>, and gave me <quote xml:id="q-050" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_26:39 #_Mark_14:36 #_Luke_22:42">a bitter cup to
           drink</quote>, both in his death and after it, which I humbly beseech him (in great
              mercy to his faithful servant and widow) to sanctify to me, and to <quote xml:id="q-051" type="allusion" source="#_Luke_14:27">enable

          <p>
           And to perform all my duty to God and man as <quote xml:id="q-053" type="allusion" source="#_Luke_12:42">a faithful steward</quote> 
           of what he has vouchsafed to entrust me withal, that so by his grace 
        I may be assisted and upholden. And</p>
         <p>
         
           that in thy sight, O Lord, my God, grant that I may there take sanctuary
           
           from all my sins, which is the cause of my suffering. And, O my God, I 
           beseech thee, give me succour and support under all my calamities that my
              soul faint not before thou deliver me.
         </p>

          <p>

              For I am poor, despised and distressed, slandered and abused for doing
           my duty, and serving thee in my calling in thy holy church and bringing up my
              children in thy holy faith and fear. All thy storms has gone over me and <quote xml:id="q-054" type="allusion" source="#KJV_1Timothy_5:5">I am
           desolate and forlorn</quote>, without comfort in this world; only in thee, O God, have I hope.</p>

         <p> Grant that my soul may not faint or despair, for I am feeble and
           sore smitten. Oh, help me now, O my gracious God, who has so often delivered me out of many deaths and brought me to be a widow, and so in a
        more peculiar property to be relieved; <quote xml:id="q-055" type="partial" source="#BCP_Psalter_Psalm68:5">for thou art the father of the fatherless

        I have no strength against my spiritual enemies but only in thy

           At the time of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> decease, it pleased
           God to spare my life to live to see (through many tribulations,
           sorrows, trials, dangers and deliverances) the 41st year of my 
           age and seven months. <milestone xml:id="ev3-start" unit="event"/>I, being born at <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>, <date when-custom="1626-02-13">February 13, 1626</date>,<anchor xml:id="ev3-end" type="event"/> 

           so that in <date when-custom="1626-02-13">February 13, 1668</date>, I completed the age of 42nd

         <p>
          
           The number of my years in the married estate of my life
           was 16 years and nine months and two days 
              which I lived in this honourable but troubled estate of life (St <quote xml:id="q-064" type="allusion" source="#_Hebrews_13:4 #_1Corinthians_7:28">Paul</quote>).

        <p>
              What sorrows and afflictions it pleased my God to lay

          willing to have undergone them all with pleasure if I might have 
          enjoyed still the comfort of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> life and health.
           But I was not worthy of so great a mercy — he being prepared 
          for a better place to enjoy his God in glory when he laid down his this 
          body — or can I sufficiently bless my God, who gave him to me and continued him so long in this mortal life to be an example to 
          this world of his great virtues. And pray that his posterity may 
          follow the same.

       of my innocency and confirmed by an unspotted, virtuous life, I had

            given the world testimony of in all my life and conversation.</p>

        <p>

          
          
    
    <milestone xml:id="ev11-start" unit="event"/>
          And that I might be assured in all passages and on all occasions, 
          I was so clearly vindicated by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> faithful 
           and tender dear expressions, and constant zealous belief and affection 
         
           towards me, and assurance of my faithful and entire conjugal fidelity
              of me, insomuch that he declared to <persName ref="ppl:awn1">my aunt Norton</persName> and to
           <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> — upon my bitter cries to stay him from going to
           <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName> for fear he should fall into a fit of the palsy —
         </p>

         <p>
           he declared to them that he was much troubled to leave me
           in that weak condition I, then, was in by those slanders. But that as he

          knew best my fidelity towards him and virtue all my days, so he
          could not be satisfied in his own conscience until he had vindicated 
           my cause and righted me against that abominable beast, <persName ref="ppl:xt8">Mr Tancred</persName>, 
           who envied anyone's chastity but was always an enemy to his family 
          
           before I came into it and so, out of malice, had injured me for his
           sake. He then did protest he went on no other business but that 
           and was resolved to be revenged of him for it. But charged them not 

tell me of it for the grief would kill his most chaste and <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">dear wife</rs>.
           <anchor xml:id="ev11-end" type="event"/>
         </p>

         <p>
           This account of so great and signal affection of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my ever-dear 
           husband</rs> can never be forgot, nor buried in oblivion, whose 
           honest integrity — to me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">his children</rs> showed in so remarkable 
           and public a manner — did evidence the truth to the whole world.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-027"/>






         <p>
           Besides, he knew the fears I had upon me all along since 
          he fell down into his fit of palsy, and my own great apprehension of his death to fall suddenly — as also, my own great illness 
           and many weakness on myself upon every such fit — did press 
           much upon my spirit; lest we both should be snatched from 
          <rs ref="ppl:rt2 ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">our dear children</rs>, and they left in a forlorn condition of <rs ref="ppl:wt1 ppl:awt1" type="group">both their
          parents</rs> gone and solely left orphans. </p>
         <p>

           
              
           <milestone xml:id="ev12-start" unit="event"/>
           This consideration did move us to accept of the motion to
              dispose of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">our eldest daughter</rs> in marriage — when she attained
           some years fit for that change — unto <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Thomas Comber</persName>, then
              minister of <placeName ref="place:Ston_054">Stonegrave</placeName>, who <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> deemed to be a
              man of great abilities, learning and parts, and in his own phrase did
           say, if he lived 'would be a very great man in the church', and he
          believed would be a bishop before he died.
         </p>

         <p>
           
           These things encouraged <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and myself to go on
         
           with this motion and did consent to it and made several articles
           of agreement concerning the same with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Thomas Comber</persName> (before
           <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> death, with good satisfaction to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, 
                  <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> and myself).
         </p> 

          <p>
            But this affair was not to be managed publicly — for many
            reasons betwixt <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and myself — until further opportunity.

            And he, well knowing this design, could not be blamed to be so
              earnest and zealous in the vindication of my wronged honour and
            abused innocency by such slanderous and viperous malicious tongues.<anchor xml:id="ev12-end" type="event"/></p>

          <milestone xml:id="ev13-start" unit="event"/>
           The consideration of these arguments used
            by my friends to comfort
         

               me did avail towards some moderation of my grief for those wicked
           practices, being joined to the examination of those people in the house
           (which had heard malicious speeches) before <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
               who utterly denied on oath that they had ever seen or heard from me
           in their lives any evil, or what they falsely objected to them, lamenting much
           that they had not told of it before that it might have been punished.
           And that they never believed any ill of me, who hated anything of
               that kind in all and ever given them good counsel and example.<anchor xml:id="ev13-end" type="event"/></p>
        

         <p> But the sad dispensation of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> death at this
           juncture of time, and his great and inexpressible love for me (as before
          expressed) to lose him now did aggravate my sorrows extremely, as it
          heightened my love and honour
             for his memory.

           unhappy circumstances — which was not fit then to publish
           to those who would make a false gloss upon my miseries,

            which fell on me by the change of
            my single life and my entering in to the estate
          of marriage — where it fell out to prove so fatal to me and my
          comfort. <milestone xml:id="ev14-start" unit="event"/>When I was obliged to marry so remote from all

          dearest enjoyment for my spiritual comfort, and remove to
           such places (where I had no support in the enjoyment of my
          own religion in the profession of the Church of England or

           So that I had not for two years afterward the benefit
           or satisfaction of receiving the Holy Sacrament or preaching
           of the word of God by lawful ministry, ordained by the
          episcopal ordination of our church, but was compelled
          to hear none but those of the presbyterian or other dissenting
          parties which was no small grief to me while I was at <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName>. Until by providence, after I came to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, I got the

           for his master's call. He had done his endeavour to serve him in his
           station of ministry of his holy word and though this was, to others, a
              sudden change, it was not so to him. He had endeavoured with

         <p>
           But at this time, which was but at the beginning of their
          reign, this <persName ref="ppl:xh3">Hoyle</persName> sat with them and had a great vote being a man
          through laid in their practices and a deep presbyterian. Had one 
           <persName ref="ppl:pn1">Nesbit</persName>, which was of that stamp too, which <rs ref="ppl:pn1" type="person">man</rs> was the man that <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr
          Syddall</persName> made use of upon the account of confidence in his
          friendship, who made him believe he would be faithful to
           him and, upon his application and desire that request, he would
           solicit <persName ref="ppl:xh3">his uncle Hoyle</persName> to gain the parliament's consent that
          he might enjoy this living according to his presentation.</p>
         <p> He did fully promise to do this act of kindness and was well
           assured that he could prevail with <rs ref="ppl:xh3" type="person">his uncle</rs> — who, he said, could
          have anything granted that he desired of them — was confident
          that he could get this done for <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName>, upon which hopes
           he rested a long time. And at last, he put <persName ref="ppl:pn1">Nesbit</persName> more fully
          for a positive answer: was told that he had done his endeavour
          to <rs ref="ppl:xh3" type="person">his uncle</rs> for <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> to get him that request granted
          as to obtain it for him (the living) to enjoy it as it was given
           by <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my brother</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs>, et cetera.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-037"/>






         <p>
     
           But, truly, <rs ref="ppl:xh3" type="person">his uncle</rs> told him it would not be granted
          that <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> might have it because they would not let
          any have the power to bestow livings which was suspected to
         
           be delinquents, but would present to them, themselves; so that it
          was in vain for <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> to trouble himself any more
           about it and (if he would take his counsel) not to do it,
         </p>

         <p>
           which unexpected return of <persName ref="ppl:pn1">Mr Nesbit</persName> was very much
           trouble to <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName>. And he told him that <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">his patron</rs> was at

           underage and had never done anything contrary to the parliament,
           nor <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my lady</rs> neither and wondered why they should be suspected.</p>

         <p>
     
           He answered, he knew not but the parliament was resolved
          not to do it and had thoughts to bestow it otherwise.
           Thus, went off all the sincere friendship (of a pretended one but
         
               none in heart) for, being half Scot by birth and a strict presbyterian
              by profession, <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> was not aware of this double deceit
              in him, both as to nation and opinion.</p>

         <p>
           So that it is a true belief, they both have a false quarter in them
            and this <persName ref="ppl:pn1">Nesbit</persName> made it fully appear, both before God and man,
           who — while he made <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> (good man) believe he was speaking
         
           for him — all that while was acting for himself and to get this living
              for himself.
         </p>

         <p>
     

           He, having under the notion of friendship, got some footsteps
          in his discourse how to bend his way, took advice
           of his friends and,
          perceiving that <persName ref="ppl:ms1">Mr Syddall</persName> and we all were of the Church of England
           which he mortally hated, knew by that clew how to wind up his
           information and upon that bottom
            proceeded against us all.
         </p>

         <p>
           Which was a piece of the greatest treachery, being acted against
          a poor family, that cannot be paralleled
           but by his own nation:
           who, first betrayed his sacred majesty, <persName ref="ppl:cs1">King Charles I</persName>, and then
           sold him and imbrued their hand in his innocent blood.<anchor xml:id="ev28-end" type="event"/>

        <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev29-start" unit="event"/>
          But <persName ref="ppl:xh3">his uncle Hoyle</persName> and himself had time enough to repent
          of this guilt of the <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">king's</rs> blood, though God did not give him the grace. For
           after that horrid murder, he, being one of the deepest in his actings and
           consent, yet — when his conscience flew in his face for his wickedness —
          was never quiet, night or day, but still cried out he saw <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs> 
          follow him without a head, and said he had no hand in his blood. But
           sometimes looked back, said, 'I am damned 
           for the blood of <rs ref="ppl:cs1" type="person">the king</rs>' and,
           as we were truly informed, died in this manner as if distracted, but could
          never find ease, nor repentance or comfort though all the godly clergy
           was about him. God deliver us from blood guiltiness, and this above all.</p>

              And, as we were credibly informed, did afterwards hang
              himself out of consciousness of his crime he was guilty of,
              against that innocent martyr whose blood yet cries

              As to the making way for <persName ref="ppl:pn1">Nesbit</persName> to get the possession of
          the parsonage of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_031">Kirklington</placeName>, it was found the most plausible
              to be done by proving <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my dear brother, George Wandesford</persName>, to
              be a delinquent to the parliament. By which means, he not
          only forfeited his right to present to that living but also thereby
              forfeited all his whole estate, which struck all the family, roots and

              branch, which profitable prospect — to enjoy <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">this poor gentleman's</rs> estate —
          was an undeniable argument to prevail for the gift of this 
       living to <persName ref="ppl:pn1">Nesbit</persName> by the parliament, who gained so well by his information . And such was his art he used that he prevailed for a

      </p>
         
      <p>
      
        Which showed the height of malice and covetousness to grind
          the face of the poor, which at this time was fallen upon us, being
        but lately fled from the horrid Irish rebellion, wherein we were

               designed to have been murdered and escaped that misery, we fell
        under this second persecution by the factions in <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> (which
          may be accounted from the root of that said popery, which designed
        a catastrophe upon <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName>, also to the true Christian faith).</p>

         <p>
      
           But alas, what had <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs>, myself or my

           of our opinion and true faith against their heathenism.

           But, blessed be (to) God, it was not in their power to destroy us; though

           for our deliverance. Oh, that I may never forget the goodness of our

           They would have had them, by cross-examination, to have confessed
           they saw him fight and forced them to have sworn to it
          but the poor men, perceiving they aimed to make them swear
           to a false thing, told the committees that they never would take

           a false oath against any man, for any gain in the

           dear society and comfort of <rs ref="ppl:cw1 ppl:aow1" type="group">my most dear parents'</rs> conduct.<anchor xml:id="ev39-end" type="event"/></p>
         
         <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev39a-start" unit="event"/>
         
           But <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dearest mother</rs>, willing to serve the family in what she
          could with reference to some comfortable settlement for me, in her
          judgement could have wished otherwise to have disposed of me
           nearer hand to herself and my friends (and there being <rs ref="ppl:edg1 ppl:gg1" type="group">two parents</rs> living
           with five younger children, undisposed or provided for and a house
           to build from the ground).</p>
         <p>
            

           And upon inquiry, found not clear £400<am>l</am>  per annum, she
           deemed <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> estate — considering these circumstances mentioned — too
            much below my fortune which <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my honoured father</rs> and herself could
           give me. Besides, at that time, a clear match or two proposed (as <persName ref="ppl:xa3">Colonel
              Anstruther</persName>

                  and my <persName ref="ppl:cd2">Lord Darcy's</persName> son, <persName ref="ppl:cd3">Colonel Darcy</persName>) of £1500
            per annum and more.
            </p>
           <p>
             She doubted I should enter upon an encumbered estate and reduced

         to very great trouble; wished me to consider what I would do, desiring
             God to direct me. But, considering the ill consequences might follow a
           denial, if I could consent in my own judgement, was willing (but 
             not to impose) to satisfy them. Oh, what a strait was we brought to in
          this great affair!<anchor xml:id="ev39a-end" type="event"/></p>
         

         <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev40-start" unit="event"/>
          Again, I considered that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> relations was opposite to
           my opinion of the Church of England and religion and if he, himself, had
          been of the same rigid
               
             opinion of the presbyterians, I could by no means
           have granted to dispose so of myself (to be miserable in the great concern of
         
           my soul and to <quote xml:id="q-086" type="allusion" source="#_Genesis_3:16">bring forth children</quote> so to be educated).
            </p>

            <p>
     

              In this point I was resolved to put to the trial by declaring to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
              that I supposed he was not ignorant of my judgement and religion, wherein I was educated in the faith of God and the profession of the true protestant
              Church of England: in it, I have lived and did by God's grace intend to die,
              so that — if he was not of the same faith with me — we should be miserable and
          I would not for all the world match myself to so great misfortune.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-042"/>






            

         <p>Nor could he have any satisfaction to have one of a contrary
           opinion to himself. Therefore, desired him to forbear any further
          suit in that way, not being comfortable to either; for he might match
          with such which was more suitable in all regards than myself, and I was
               so happy in my condition of a single life that I loved it above all,


            
           
           having the excellent company and example of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my honoured mother</rs>.

           </p>
           <p>
         
             
             After this discourse, most seriously and candidly delivered to
              him, I perceived his great trouble in mind. And told me that he
              was well satisfied with my opinion, and religion and all things

            else concerned me — being much above his
             hopes, desert or expectation —
             and
             also did assure me faithfully that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">he, himself</rs>, was of the same
             opinion and was for a moderated episcopacy and kingly government,
            
          owning that the best. And that I should enjoy my own conscience as 
             I desired, if I honoured him to marry with him and to bring up my children in
          the same faith, he did profess to me, both now and at all times.</p>
         <p> Having this assurance <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">from himself</rs>, whereby the main
          point of my religion was secured to me and my posterity, if I had any,
          I was the less concerned for riches or the splendour of the world, and hoped
           in God I might enjoy that one thing necessary (as Mary did) which
          might never be taken from me if I chose here.</p>
         <p>
       

           He, having the character all his life of a very honest, sober
           and conscientious man, and much beloved and esteemed in his <placeName ref="place:Ryed_129">country</placeName>
           (although the estate was not so dear or great as others) yet I hoped

               to live with comfort in the chiefest matters of a married estate, with
          comfort in the obedience I owed to <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> choice.
           And which was more encouragement to me, that I might be serviceable
           to <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my honoured
             father's</rs> family in being instrumental to preserve
            
          or deliver it from that inevitable ruin fallen upon it.
           And, by this means of my acceptance of this match, I might be a
           blessing to that noble family of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my honoured father</rs> from whence I
           am descended and prevent the <quote xml:id="q-087" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_17:12">greedy lion</quote> which watched for his

         <p>
           
           
           I cannot deny my great unwillingness (contrary to my
            
           resolves to continue my single condition) to consent to that
           change,<anchor xml:id="ev40-end" type="event"/> which involved me into a thousand miseries which I could
              not foresee or imagine that fell upon me, which made my life
           very uneasy in most of the periods. For, instead of deputing
          much of my fortune to pious uses and bestowed on Christian
           charity on many urgent necessities, as I designed when single,


        <pb xml:id="page-043"/>






           

           I was plunged into great troubles and burdens upon the estate
              charged with a jointure on the half of that and five younger children
              to provide portions and maintenance for them, together with a
           house to build before we could live at his estate. <milestone xml:id="ev41-start" unit="event"/>Though, all the

         <p>

            family in all time of danger, troubles of sickness, childbearing

         <p>
           We coming to live at <placeName ref="place:Oswa_041">Oswaldkirk</placeName> before our house at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>

            but much more pressures on my spirit (from the comforts of my
           spiritual concern). It pleased God to lay another affliction on me,
              added to the rest; was a great and dreadful sickness, being visited

           Which was aggravated in my sorrows by the consideration

          dear mother's</rs> articles of marriage with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> upon which
          the marriage proceeded. Videlicet: that in regard of so great a fortune

         <p>
            
           it was covenanted that (by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, his own draft of them)
          the whole estate should be so settled on my issue, male or female,
           that he could not have cut off the entail from them but, after our
           decease, my children by him was to enjoy the same which God did give
            
           me. But, contrary to this settlement before marriage, the lawyer

              the writings which left it in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> power to cut the entail off
              from my children when he would, so that there was no estate

         <p>
    
         
           In my great sickness, looking for nothing but death and how to
          prepare for it, I was somewhat more concerned; as it did behove
          me, in going out of the world, how the estate was made firm to
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two poor children</rs> in case of my mortality.
             <anchor xml:id="ev50-end" type="event"/>
         </p>
         
         <p>

         
           
           And I was the more concerned because — <milestone xml:id="ev51-start" unit="event"/>when I was at <placeName ref="place:StNi_050">St Nicholas</placeName>
           after <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> death, was then big with child — it happened that
           at that time the happy restoration of <persName ref="ppl:cs2">King Charles II</persName> and of his
           coming into <placeName ref="place:Engl_094">England</placeName> and restored the church and state to its rights
           again. There was a great and general rejoicing at that good
           change in <rs ref="place:Engl_094" type="place">the kingdom</rs> from tyranny, oppression and anarchy.</p>
         <p> My being with child then, <persName ref="ppl:awn1">my dear aunt Norton</persName> told
           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and myself that, if I had a son, he would bring his
          name with him into the world and should be called Charles. But <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> answered again that it should not; after which, being in private
          with him, I desired to know what was the reason he would not have
           him called Charles, if I had a son. He presently answered, if I would
          have him so called, he should never heir a foot of his estate.<anchor xml:id="ev51-end" type="event"/>
         </p>
         <p>
               
           Which return made to my question was very surprising
            
           to me and put me upon thoughts in what condition my children
              would be in, if I left them and had died of that child? But <milestone xml:id="ev52-start" unit="event"/><rs ref="ppl:wt2" type="person">my sweet child</rs>
              was born there and I reduced to great weakness in bearing him. And <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
                Thornton</persName> had his choice of that name (called him <persName ref="ppl:wt2">William</persName>) <anchor xml:id="ev52-end" type="event"/><milestone xml:id="ev52a-start" unit="event"/>but it did not
           please God to let him live with us but died at 19 days old of the smallpox.
         <anchor xml:id="ev52a-end" type="event"/>
         </p>
         <p> So, God disappointed us of that comfort and I hope he inherits in his
           heavenly Father's kingdom and so forever is provided for.</p>
         <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev53-start" unit="event"/>
          This was a sufficient motive of trouble to me (joined with the rest
          and to that of my sickness) that I was like to go out of this world
           and leave <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two poor innocent daughters</rs> without any settlement
          or provision firm, though all <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> care and charges to have it
          done. But how unjust was these lawyers to deceive those which depended
          on their fidelity?  Only in my God to whom I prayed for direction and help.</p>
         <p>
            

           In my distress, therefore,  I made application to <persName ref="ppl:rl2">my cousin, Mr Legard</persName>,
              who understood the law, to read the deeds of settlement who did assure
              me that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had that power left him to cut off the entail
              of the estate and settle it upon any woman and her children, and to disinherit mine after my death. Upon which, I desired his favour to speak
              to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> to do something to ascertain a portion equivalent

           until it pleased God a firm estate could be made for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two daughters</rs>.
          And upon this, it pleased God to move <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> heart to consent.</p>

           He did draw up a bond for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> to sign of £3000 to secure each of them the sum of £1500 for their portions, which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> did do for the
           present in case of my death then. And so, by this he had
              the whole estate to dispose of from them if I had died.
         </p>
         <p>
           These terms I could not help, as my condition
           was then more like to die than otherwise, but he did promise that
           if I lived <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would settle his estate according to the
          articles of marriage. It pleased God to restore my health again
           and in some measure (as to this) more satisfied for the present.<anchor xml:id="ev53-end" type="event"/></p>

           But, then, my greatest concern was more for the right
           education of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two poor children</rs> in the faith of the Church
          of England, which did much more concern me than that
          for their temporal provision, and this was a heavy 
          burden for me to bear on my weak spirit, that I should
           leave <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two children</rs> under such a jurisdiction.</p>

         <p> For I found all here — in relation to this family — to be
          contrary in their judgement to my hopes or expectation,
           very much fixed either in the way and bitter profession of the
           presbytery or severe and positive papists (as all <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
           own relations were and his <rs ref="ppl:wt1">father's</rs> <persName ref="ppl:dt1">first wife</persName> were too).</p>

          <p>
               

            
            This made me destitute and out of hopes to leave the
            care of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my children's</rs> souls to be right educated in the true
          faith and holy Church of England, and was a most bitter pill
          to me in this juncture of my sickness: how to have them taken
          care for in this main point and one thing necessary to their
          salvation? My soul was grieved and mourned for this sad

         effect of my marriage: to leave my posterity in such hazard (if 
          they lived) to be brought up in such a way of ignorance or of
            idolatry. Great was my sorrow and distress of mind not having
          any comforter or guide of my soul, nor any that I could advise
            withal what to do in this point which sad consideration made
          me reflect upon the ill consequence of marrying contrary to judgement.</p>

           But while I was in deep distress which way to turn myself for relief to find redress, and Satan urging me still to despair as
          if my God had forsaken me, I was resolved to cast myself down
           at the feet of my gracious Jesus: who brought into my heart (ready to
          sink under infinite burdens then) that glorious light of his holy

           gospel came into my heart, by his Holy Spirit which he spoke

            
            with his blessed mouth in <ref source="#_Matthew_11:28-30">St Matthew 11:28-30 verses</ref>  which
              cannot sufficiently mention: <quote xml:id="q-090" type="direct" source="#GB_Matthew_11:28">Come unto me all ye that are
           weary and heavy laden, and I will give you ease</quote>, et cetera.

           Thus was the fiery darts which Satan shot against my poor
          soul to make me despair of the everlasting mercy to fall on me
           and bring me deliverance; at the moment when his strongest assaults
          was like to prevail to overthrow my faith and persuade that the day of

grace was past and my death was come, <quote xml:id="q-091" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_25:30">my life was so unprofitable</quote>
          and God did not lay such heavy affliction upon any who was

         <p> But, oh, the fathomless goodness of the great and almighty 
           saviour of the world, whose business into this world was to seek
          and save all those that believed on him and to redeem lost man when
           he was not able to save himself. Now did this Almighty God put
           to flight, by the mighty power of his holy word in this scripture,
          that fiery dragon which goeth about seeking whom he may devour, night
           and day, and with this holy word gave me his spirit to assist my
           poor and weak spirit, making his mercy known to me — his faithful
           handmaid — who was almost overthrown by despair of his
          mercy through instigations of the spiritual enemy.</p>
         <p> And caused the light of his sacred word to shine into my
          dark and dead soul, causing me to fly unto him for succour and relief
           when Satan would have had me to run from him who, alone, could
           and would help me in and out of my sad distress.

          After our coming to our house at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> to live — and I was
          by the wonderful mercies of God so well recruited that I was able
          to come on foot thither — it was thought upon to make some
           paper books, which was drawn at London by <persName ref="ppl:rl2">my cousin Legard</persName>,
           
          in order to an entail on my issue general, male or female.</p>
         <p>
         

           But not according to a firm entail upon them, as it was
          designed by the articles of my marriage, but still the power was
          reserved in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> to place <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> on his heirs male by
           a second wife and provide for her children, and so, thereby, to disinherit my children of their birth right and inheritance which
          Almighty God had given them.
                  
                 
       Upon the perusal 
      of which paper books, I found they were not drawn according
      to promise, nor the articles of my marriage. I found myself much disappointed by the conditions: to be willing to
           defraud my poor children of their right which I, then alive.
      Besides none but God knew whether <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">that child I was then big with</rs>
      might be a son or a daughter, and then there would be more females to provide for (having been forced by the taking the assignment

            

           of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Mr Norton</persName> to sell his land at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName>, which was the provision
           for his younger children, to pay off <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> his debt, which should
          have been paid out of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> Irish estate but now was cast on
           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and all his younger children unprovided for).</p>

         <p>
            

         I could not yield that these books should be engrossed as
      they were, whereby I and my posterity should be cut off their
           right of inheritance, being contrary to that standing ordinance
      made by Almighty God himself in the case of Zelopehad's

        
           daughters which he expressly charged to Moses in 
           <ref source="#_Numbers_27:1">Numbers 27, verse 1</ref>.

     </p>

         <p>
         
           Nor had I, here, any kinsman, brother or friend of my
              own to stand for my interest or my children's, to consult withal
              in the case to have advice how to have the writings drawn firm
           to them, according to law, in a case so much concerned myself and
              posterity since <persName ref="ppl:rl2">Mr Legard</persName> had proved so biased against us.<anchor xml:id="ev62-end" type="event"/></p>
         

         <p>
    
          Besides this failure — in the right and just settlement to be made
          in <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> estate and land to be done for my poor children
          of my body — <milestone xml:id="ev63-start" unit="event"/>there was another wrong done me by the drawing up
          of a deed of settlement and disposal of all <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> personal
          estate, which she


        <pb xml:id="page-052"/>






            
           


        by her last will and testament had given to me to dispose
           of it as I should think fit (by will or deeds) to such child
          or children as was best deserving. And put the property of her
          said goods and personal estate into feoffees in trust for my life
           and to have power to dispose of it at my death.</p>
         <p>
            

           To which purpose, I, not hoping to live long in this life
              so full of sorrows and trouble, sickness and crosses — being to pass through
              that dreadful dangers of childbirth, coming out of them
              with dangers and difficulties — desired <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Henry Best</persName>, who had
            married <rs ref="ppl:kwd1" type="person">my sister's</rs> daughter, <persName ref="ppl:kdb1">Katherine Danby</persName>,

            </p>
         <p>
           that he would please to draw up a deed of gift, with a
              schedules
                   annexed which part each of my children should have
              according to <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> will and deed, and to the power she had
              given me: that they should not be made liable to the debts
              or engagements which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> had been so
           unfortunately drawn into by the assignment.</p>
         <p> For she pleased to say the reason why she disposed them,
           thus: that why should my bed be taken from under me by those
          debts which he ought not to pay?</p>
         <p>
            
           But this <persName ref="ppl:hb1">nephew Best</persName> forfeited his trust, and drew
          those deeds after such a manner as did flatly ruin my

         

           <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">dear mother's</rs> care of me and mine. And made the
              deed absolutely to give <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> goods and moneys all into
              the power of the creditors, which was a very grand wrong to
           me and mine. But, upon the reading the deed after the engrossing, I found the fallacy to be contrary to the feoffee  
              draft and I would not sign it.
          <anchor xml:id="ev63-end" type="event"/></p>
         

          <p>
            Thus, by the mercies of my gracious God, I was delivered

            at this time also (and my children also). Therefore, will I praise
            the Lord, my God, forever for his preventing goods to me and
          mine, and did preserve us from these dangers in our estate.</p>

         <p>
    
         
            

           
           <milestone xml:id="ev64-start" unit="event"/>Finding my time of delivery was drawing near — and
          not having any to put my confidence in as a faithful friend
            
           to draw the deeds and settlement of the estate right, that I might
        not have my posterity injured when I might be disposed of by
           death — I cast myself down before the <quote xml:id="q-122" type="phrase" source="#_Hebrews_4:16">throne of grace</quote>,
        humbly begging of God his assistance to direct me to some
        good, faithful friend and able lawyer, which would draw up
        such writings and settlement in this poor estate which might
           (might) make a firm settlement and provision for my children,
   </p>

   <p>
        as well for the just inheritance as provision for younger
        children's portions and maintenance out of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>



        <pb xml:id="page-053"/>






         land and estate in <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, which land  by the marriage articles
          was left as a provision for his heir, as <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> for my jointure
          and the land of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> was settled for the provision of his

           After I had poured out my complaint to God and made my
            petition to him, it came into my thoughts that <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin,
              Roger Covill</persName>, was a very able lawyer and a good honest man
           (a friend to our family and had done many offices of kindness for

          us) and that I hoped <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> would accept of him to give
          his advice and assistance in the case.</p>
         
         <p> To him I applied myself in this case and confided in him to
          being an able and good counsels, and I hoped would draw up a
          good and substantial deed of entail of the whole estate to be
           settled: <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> for my jointure, during life and after our decease,
           upon my issue, male or female,

           according to the articles of marriage.
         </p>
         <p> 
           <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was also so settled and entailed on my issue in like
           manner, with such provisions: first, out of it made firm to <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my
             two daughters</rs> for provision for maintenance and portions for them,
           before <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> (in case of my death) or his heir male after him



               

           could enjoy that estate, and the sum of £1600  to be paid to
           them. This deed of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill's</persName> (Dated: <date when-custom="1662-06-03">June 3rd — 1662</date>).

         </p>

         <p>
              This settlements, and all of these concerns of the right fixing
              the estate upon my poor children, has cost me very many sorrows and many sums of money for charges, upon this concern
           to get this poor estate fixed for my issue — besides much grief that
           befell me on such occasions of alterations, and cutting off entails —
            </p>

            <p>
              being loath to go out of this world and leave my children

              miserable. And <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was pleased to make this so
              stated and in this deed in this manner; in consideration, as he said,
          that he had a great fortune with me and that the land at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName>
              was sold to pay debts (which was settled for my younger children's
          before my marriage) and to perform his promise

            before <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName>.
         </p>
         
         <p>
    
         And, also, at that time — on condition that <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> should be
           set apart for that purpose — I was willing to grant to part with my £1000
            
           (£1000

               
           part of my portion in Ireland) to pay <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts,
           which was secured by him by bond to trustees, for my use before marriage,


            

           as an addition of my jointure for my life (because all the rest of my
              fortune was for him to dispose and that the estate at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> was very inconsiderable, as <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> and friends thought).
          </p>

      <p>
            And this I yielded, out of my love to him
        
              
            and
         his children, to pay
        his remaining debts. And whereas, by <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my own mother's</rs> jointure
        and <persName ref="ppl:edg1">Mr Thornton's</persName>, they had the liberty of the wood mentioned with 
        the clause of 'without the impeachment of any manner of waste',</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-054"/>






            

         <p>in regard of the consideration of my valuable fortune, it
           was — by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> consent and of his own act of kindness —
          he did make it so in my jointure at <placeName ref="place:East_019">East Newton</placeName> also.</p>
         <p>
            
           But, at this time, I was willing for the good of the family

         and my children to have this liberty (which I might have had)
              and power left in me to cut down all the wood to either help
           myself or et cetera. To be only expressed that I had power for firebote,
           housebote, hedgebote and for myself to make use of, for repair
              and necessary uses. But how far this hath obliged some of the
              family to regard me accordingly — when I had nothing left me
              to maintain my son, if I should have one — I knew not. But

            have had sufficient cause to repent my kindness, being left
          <quote xml:id="q-123" type="allusion" source="#KJV_1Timothy_5:5">a desolate widow</quote> and not any allowance to educate <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my poor
            son</rs>, who God did after bestow on me, <date when-custom="1662-09-19">September 19th,
             1662</date>.
         </p>
         <p>
           (Besides an infinite debts left for to be paid after <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
           death, and little and nothing to pay withal.)</p>
         <p>
           I yielded all these privileges, and my £1000 portion and
          to take upon me the education of <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my son</rs> out of my single
           jointure, on conditions <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two daughters</rs> should be secured
           their portions of £1600
             and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts remaining
            to be paid.
         
          All which I took to be acts of signal love, affection and kindness
           to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and children, hoping to God those good ends
           would follow for which I did them. But there was a contrary
        use made of all these condescensions.</p>
         <p> For — having done all these things above mentioned, to my
        great detriment and loss in my estate, to satisfy <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and to pay
        all his debts (though I knew not what they were or to whom) —
        I had hopes to believe that the estate of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> might have been
           kept entire in that capacity, according to the true intent of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName>
           deed (done with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> full consent and not urged but voluntary done,
        and with great equity towards his children and debts).<anchor xml:id="ev65-end" type="event"/></p>
         

         <p>
         
               
         
         <milestone xml:id="ev66-start" unit="event"/>
         But how this deed was evaded or when, I knew not, or on
        what occasion. Only I remember <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Harry Best</persName> asked me if I would

         
              not grant that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">his uncle</rs> should have one or two of the closes in <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
         to be made liable to secure a little debt he owed to <persName ref="ppl:hc1">Sir Henry Cholmley</persName>.

         </p>

            <p>
         I told him again, I knew not of any debt to<persName ref="ppl:hc1"> Sir Henry Cholmley</persName>
                  
              and, if he did owe him anything, I hope I had done enough to
              clear that and all his debts by giving up all <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> to be sold
              and my £1000, which was above £3000,
              besides my £1500 
              portion out of <placeName ref="place:Kirk_131">Kirklington</placeName>. I was much concerned he owed more.
            </p>

         <p>
           After this discourse, I told him I could not grant to unsettle
           the estate of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, which I came so hardly by and cost me so much
           and was all I had left for my children and could not do it.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-055"/>






         <p>
           And I was assured he could not cut off the entail without my
           consent, which I never would do it. After a little time, he said
          <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">his uncle</rs> would do it without me and it were better to consent willingly
          and oblige him. I answered that I had yielded to destroy myself
           and I hope he would not desire such a hard thing against my children.</p>
         <p> But I, trusting in this <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName>, as to be a faithful friend to
           me, and that he would give me his advice, upon reading the deed,
           whether <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had power to cut it off without my consent
           because <persName ref="ppl:rc2">cousin Covill</persName> charged me not to consent; for, if I did, it
           would destroy the inheritance and he could not do it without me.
         </p>


         <p>

               

           (But how this deed of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill's</persName> was evaded, or when it was
              done, I knew not until long after, being kept in a wholesome ignorance
           except, upon <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Harry Best's</persName> reading it upon my desire to be satisfied
           of him, as a friend to myself and poor children, being so near in
           relation — desired his cordial advice to me upon that point).
            </p>


            <p>
              He, having read that deed over, pretended that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">his uncle</rs>
              had power to destroy it on pretence of a flaw he found of a contingency to fall out, in case of my decease, to provide for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two daughters</rs>
              to have a portion and education fixed, being the essential part of that
              deed. Which, when he had done, said <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">his uncle</rs> had full power to destroy it without my consent and to make another, which he would
          not for anything he should know it; charging me that I should not
          tell him of it, for if he knew his power he would certainly cut
          it off and that would be ill for my children.</p>
         <p> I said, I was very sorry it was so, and I was sure <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin
          Covill</persName> did not understand he had so, for he would not have
          done it to betray me and my children. He answered that he was sure
          <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill</persName> did not know of it, for it was a new thing found out
           in law he had not been acquainted with. So, I begged him as a
           friend, and had advised with him in my children's behalf, not to discover it to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> for fear of the ill effect might follow.</p>
         <p> And withal, I had parted with all my portion of £1000  from
           myself and to sell the land at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> to have this made
           sure for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two daughters</rs> and, if this was undone, it would ruin
           them and me too. Upon which, he faithfully promised me he would
          never acquaint <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> with his power and bid me keep that deed
          up, lest at any time he might see it.</p>
         <p> Yet, notwithstanding all this fair promise to me, I was
           assured by <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, long after, the deed was destroyed then,
          at the same time he had spoke thus to me,</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-056"/>






            

         <p><persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName> went immediately out to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and 
           told him of the flaw he found in that deed by which he had
           power to cut it off and make a new one. And showed him
           the way he must go to do it and advised him to do it
           without my consent. On which, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> closed with that motion

         

            and went immediately upon that business.
         </p>

     <p>
        
       
       At which time, I suppose — as it appears by a little deed for
       two years made by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> (dated <date when-custom="1665-09-09">September 9th, 1665</date>) —
        to enable him to cut it off and gave possession to trustees, <persName ref="ppl:fd3">Mr Francis
          Darley</persName>, et cetera.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, was I (poor, innocent creature) most basely betrayed by a false friend, in betraying his trust to me
        to the utter destruction of myself and poor children, who, by
        this, had nothing in the world left them to provide for
        them, either maintenance or portions: all my land and
        own portion being already disposed for debts, et cetera.
      </p>

      <p>
       
        And another deed was made instead of better
        settling their maintenance and portions to them, which was to
        make provisions in the first place for a second wife and
        for her children's to take place before my first born child
        of my womb, and by that means to disinherit those which God
        had given me and spared out of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:ct1 ppl:jt1 ppl:rt2 ppl:xt1 ppl:xt2 ppl:wt2 ppl:et1" type="group">nine children</rs> I had borne him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, charging the said estate of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> with
        the payment of £800 to be paid to his

       own younger brothers and sisters in case of the failure of
        issue male, and that the inheritance should come to fall on my
        issue female, over and beside, with portions they received
        out of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my husband's</persName> estate before which he had told me
        was about £1500  amongst them. So, they was very well taken
        care for on all accounts, when there was no provision
        made at all for my son and heir if I had one, as I then had:
        <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son, Robert Thornton</persName>, being of three years age. A strong child.</p>
       <p>
            But it was prudence to secure a jointure and provision
         for a second wife while I was alive and had heirs of my body,
         which was all cast out, and all my fortune disposed of which
        might have been subsistence for them.</p>
       <p>
         There was also care taken by that deed to pay debts,
        all which could not have been done out of that small estate of 
        <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> which was but £120<am>l</am>
         a year.

         but a little before I was delivered of <persName ref="ppl:ct1">my last
       
          child, Christopher</persName>, nor had I suspected any such thing but
           that <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName> (upon <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> going to <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> to take his
           masters of arts degree seeing <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Mr Best</persName>) asked him from me
        whether he knew <persName ref="ppl:wt1">his uncle</persName> had made a new settlement of
        <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>. Answered he had and that I needed not make so much
        ado about it for it was better done than before.</p>
       <p>
          

         Which put me to much concern what might be the consequence
         of it, fearing what <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill</persName> told. After which, I entreated

         <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> to beg of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> that I might see it.
      He told me he had it delivered to him in trust by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
          
        and he could not betray his trust. Upon which I declared I could
        not go out of the world without I could be satisfied that my
        children were well provided for, and should be an unnatural
         mother if I had not discharged my conscience to them.
         I, being in a great danger of death upon bearing my children,
        desired that satisfaction of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my husband</persName> to see it.</p>
       <p>
          

         After which, being troubled that I should put them upon so
        unpleasant a business, yet stayed an hour and until <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>
         brought it to me. But, upon the reading of that deed, I fell
        very ill upon the consideration of the vast difference and alteration betwixt the two deeds, nor could I be satisfied until I had
        applied myself to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> — with humble request and bitter
     

         tears and complaint — to see those things mentioned, as before said.
       </p>

         <p>
       

           It pleased God, upon my humble request to the <quote xml:id="q-124" type="phrase" source="#_Hebrews_4:16">throne of
         grace</quote>, that he would have mercy on me, and my children he had
          graciously given me and continued with life, that he would please to
          let me find favour from <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my husband</persName> and that he would grant

          me those requests to have this estate to be settled for my children.

          </p>
         <p>
            And to provide for my younger children's maintenance
           and portions, so as they might not be disappointed of it when I was
          gone or himself.</p>
         <p>

               


           After which most humble petitions to my great God and
        Father of all in distress, he was pleased to grant my request and to
           move <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my husband's</persName> heart to incline to me in this thing, and to tell me,
        if <persName ref="ppl:jd2">his brother Denton</persName> would do it, he would have it done so.

         And after much discourse and arguments, used by myself and
           <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and acquainting <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
        another deed was drawn by <persName ref="ppl:jd2">brother Denton</persName>, wherein such provision
        was stated as <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and he did approve of for my children's

         decease. The half of that estate being set over to pay his debts,</p>

         which I could not prevent since his circumstances was

     But, although the £800<am>l</am> to his younger brothers and sisters
    was not mentioned in this latter deed for settlement for my

     the failure of issue male (though at that time <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> had


           

a delicate son — <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my dear son, Robert Thornton</persName>, who was at

                   The true intent and design of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Mr Covill's</persName> deed of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
            was to make provision for the <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">two younger children</rs>, which was
            cut off by the sale of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> and the land gone from that use
          so none was left but this, and to perform <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> promise
            before <persName ref="ppl:xt7">Baron Thorpe</persName> to settle on them such an estate out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
            before I did yield to pass a fine of <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> to free him from
          <persName ref="ppl:cf2">Mr Foxley's</persName> debt (who threatened by <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Mr Nettleton</persName> to execute a
          judgement of him). And, out  of my love for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>, granted
              
          upon those terms to secure the same for my children
          out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, which was never done until now by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">cousin Covill's</persName> deed.
        </p>

         <p>
           And now, having at that time none living but <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">these two
             daughters</rs>, having borne him six at <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName>, thought it high
           time to save something for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">these surviving children</rs>: and</p>
         <p> this deed of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">cousin Covill</persName> was made to provide for them two
           daughters, <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Alice</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:ktp1">Katherine</persName>, I then had and being big <rs ref="ppl:rt2">with
           child</rs>, in case I should have a son, he would heir the land
           and they would be unprovided of portion or maintenance.</p>
         <p> And in case of my decease, or a second marriage or my
          son to live, then this settlement provided for them and
          they could not be defeated of a fixed provision, which was but
          just to provide for them thus when the other land at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn
          Park</placeName> and all my portion was gone.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-059"/>






         <p>Nor could this deed be evaded by any legal right which was
          expressly made for those ends mentioned to be a security for them

           When as the very doing it was to establish that estate to
           provide for that which <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> deed was to prevent: videlicet, to settle it
              upon a second wife and her children's provision before mine, who was
              born and wanted provision, to have been had before a second wife and
           hers came in (considering also that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had received
              with me a greater fortune than would have purchased his
           estate).

            </p>

         <p>
           

           And I may
           say with too much grief, if — <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> due
      and rights I had from her estate in Ireland, <persName ref="ppl:jw1">my brother John's</persName>
           (who fell to me due, on <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother George's</persName> death) together with my 
      own rights from <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> will, the sum in all amounted to
           above £12000  more — had not been unfortunately managed
      by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> entering into that assignment of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">my uncle Norton</persName> 
           by which he not only ruined himself and me and his posterity,</p>

         <p> but I might justly say that what was received with me —
       by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother's</rs> bounty — was above what might have
           purchased <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> estate as it was besides what was lost.</p>

         <p>

            

           For I can make it appear he did receive above £8000.
              
           Therefore, how unjust an act done to my poor posterity in this
          deed by cutting off <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill's</persName> when a great sum of
          £800<am>l</am>  to be paid to the sisters and brothers, if <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> died with

            I have writ more on this subject, being the great concern
           of my life, and under what burden I laid by this means when I first
      heard it was done, when the grief had well-nigh
           cost my life and by
           which I fell into a desperate extremity by a miscarriage (<date when-custom="1666-08-16">August 16,

           Nor was I cured then by any human means. But by a
        miraculous power from heaven, who gave me power to believe in the
            
           Lord Jesus Christ only for help and deliverance and brought that portion
        of scripture into my ears, when I laid almost dead in extremity
        and desired the prayers of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">my husband</persName> and the family. <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
        saying prayers, it was the proper lesson for that day in St Matthew

        heard this holy scripture, by which means the Lord did show
        what a mighty power he had and what mercy he showed to this
        poor woman to give her faith to believe in him that he could cure
        her, and grace to come unto him for her cure.</p>

      <p>
        Thus, did my gracious saviour draw me to him at this
        time and came unto me in my distress as she was. He came into my
        heart by his holy word and miracle done to his handmaid on
        earth, and though I could not see him with my bodily eyes, yet he
        gave me grace to believe in him, who was as well able to heal
        me now he was in heaven and I on earth.</p>

         <p>
            
        Yet he was the same God and was pleased to show mercy
      in all time of my distress when I called upon him. At this time

              

        also, I laid hold on his mercy and believed he was able to deliver
        me out of this sad and lamentable condition as he did to this woman,
        and humbly begged pardon for my sins and deliverance from
           this sad calamity: <quote xml:id="q-126" type="direct" source="#_Mark_9:23-24">Lord, I believe: help my unbelief</quote>. And as <quote xml:id="q-127" type="phrase" source="#KJV_Acts_24:2">by

           at this time; oh, let me find the effects of it in thy curing of this

        health again that I may have time to <quote xml:id="q-128" type="partial" source="#_Philippians_2:12">work out my own

         For no sooner than I had poured out my praise and prayers
        to the holy Jesus, but he embraced me with the arms of his mercy
        and my soul found relief. And I was immediately healed

           the heavy pressures of this debt and interest since <date when-custom="1665-11">November 1665</date>.)

            </p>
         <p>
           And this sad distemper of the palsy, which seized on <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
             husband</rs> at that time, did at last carry him off and was the cause of
              his death: he enduring a very great many afflictions and extremities
           by fits until, at length, it prevailed against him and me by that desperate grief
              that none thought I should have lived.

            And when I saw myself reduced into so low a condition by grief
           and sorrows, upon such changes in the estate and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> illness,
          it highly concerned me take care of the disposal of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my eldest daughter</rs>
           to one who might take care both of herself and assist the rest of <rs ref="ppl:rt2 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two
             children</rs> in their education, and take care of them all when we were gone.
         </p>

         <p>
          


            So that we closed with the proposal of marriage made to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            by <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, if it pleased God she might live to
            be the age of marriage and making all the fair testimonies to prove a
            good man (pious, learned and understanding) with a great prospect of his
        deserved merits to be capable of preferment in the church and of a true and
        loyal education and zeal for it,</p>

            <p>
               

              these was great inducements to choose here, for her: to a wise, discreet
        person rather than to a great estate without those good qualifications. And these
        was the motives and ground of our choice of this match, being more enlarged
              on this subject in my 'First Book of My Widowed Condition'.<anchor xml:id="ev71-end" type="event"/></p>
      


        <p>
          I humbly made my petitions to heaven: that he would please to
          direct and guide me in this great and weighty concern of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child's</rs>
      marriage; that we might dispose of her for a blessing to herself and to us
          (<rs ref="ppl:awt1 ppl:wt1" type="group">her parents</rs>) and to me, who had with great and exceeding sorrows and pains had
      brought her out into this world as it may be more at large seen in my

          'First Book of My Life' expressed (in her birth and deliverances more at
          large) how dear she was to me. So, the Lord would continue his most
          signal care over her and mercy towards me, her poor mother, as to
          provide such an one to be <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">her
               
             husband</rs> and her guide that she might
          be a happy wife and live comfortably in this life, <quote xml:id="q-132" type="allusion" source="#_Genesis_3:16">and bring forth children</quote>
          to the glory of God and salvation of their souls, and be a comfort to each
          other in this great change of her life. <quote xml:id="q-133" type="phrase" source="#_Romans_15:30">For Jesus Christ, his sake</quote>. Amen.</p>

         <p>

             

           To all these humble petitions, I bless the Lord God of mercy,
        I hope he did vouchsafe to grant. And gave her a great share of
        happiness and prosperity as a blessing to her from heaven for her
           reward of being a <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">good and gracious child</rs> (even from her infancy,
           being both dear and tender to me and obedient to us both): full of virtue,
        piety and modesty, and many graces eminent in her youth and more
           riper years. <quote xml:id="q-134" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_136:26 #_Psalms_116:12">For which I render to the God of heaven all possible,

         </p>

         <p>
         And since I have endured so many afflictions of soul and body in
        the troublesome affairs of this life by the malicious designs of the
        devil and his instruments to hinder and frustrate all my endeavours
        for the establishment of the gospel and true faith of Jesus Christ in my
        children and family, and to cut off my poor life as he would have done to
        poor Job in moving of God to destroy him,</p>
       <p>
         yet, blessed be my gracious God and <quote source="#_2Corinthians_1:3 #BCP,_Prayer_for_Persons_Troubled_in_Mind" xml:id="q-135" type="phrase">Father of mercies</quote>, he did
        not suffer him or his instruments to prevail over me, or to destroy and
         root me out of the <quote xml:id="q-136" type="phrase" source="#_Psalms_116:9">land of the living</quote> or my posterity.</p>

           For though he came against me by his temptation, first to despair
           of Gods mercies, then tempted me to impatience and mourning,
               and too much
          grief upon <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> cutting off the entail and of immoderate
          fear for my children to want provision.

          </p>

         <p>
           After that, by grief and affliction upon that action, which by some unjust
           advice of my own friends and wrong dealing toward myself and children,

          </p>

         <p>

            I fell into a desperate miscarriage; from thence, into a fatal flood,
        near to have cast me into despair and death from which I hardly
           escaped.<anchor xml:id="ev72-end" type="event"/> Then, after these storms had blown over me, to fulfil

          
          
           the height of his implacable malice would not let me enjoy
             the great
           comfort of my life: the inward happiness I had since I was born of
           the testimony of a good conscience in a holy, chaste, good life and conversation,
        by which I received the sweet enjoyment of a <quote xml:id="q-137" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote> never yet
        defiled with the least unchaste thought, or word or action by God's holy

             

         grace (given to me ever since I was born and preserved me in).
         </p>

      <p>
           
        Yet, he and his instruments sought by unjust, lies, slanders,
      false suggestions, endeavoured to throw aspersions on me and secretly to
        wound my unspotted life and conversation by which means not only to
        murder my soul but, with one dart, to kill my poor, weak body.</p>

       <p>

            

         Nevertheless, notwithstanding all these <quote xml:id="q-138" type="allusion" source="#KJV_Ecclesiastes_7:26">snares and nets</quote> which he
        had laid for me to catch my poor soul withal, I must behold with joy
        and admiration of the fathomless goodness, mercy and compassion of</p>




        <pb xml:id="page-063"/>





         <p>
          our most gracious <quote source="#BCP,_The_Litany" xml:id="q-139" type="phrase">Father of heaven</quote> — who did hear and
          answer my humble requests, and gave me a speedy deliverance out
         of all my troubles when they fell upon me — heard my complaints,
         granted what he, in his wisdom, saw fit for me his poor creature
          and destroyed the snares that the devil and hell had laid for me</p>

         <p>

            

           to have destroyed me and mine. And, thus, did he, <quote xml:id="q-140" type="allusion" source="#KJV_1Corinthians_10:13">in his good
           providence, make a way for us to escape</quote> and brought good out
           of evil, light out of darkness and, in the midst of all my deep
           distress, made a way for to escape both from the destruction

            of this poor estate, from settling
           it from my children and family.
         </p>

         <p>
           And more firmly got it, thereby, settled on them without
          any more alterations — I bless my God — during <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>
          life time; nor did he withhold his great mercy from me
           by drawing his faithful and conjugal love and affection from me,
          for all those bloody and wicked practices of all my secret enemies to have made him have taken his endeared affection
          away from me, which would have been worse than death to me.</p>

         <p>

         

           Which he had so many years experiences of my faith
         and truth to him in the actual, candid and sincere practice
        of my chaste life and conversation, which I had ever followed
        with an unspotted reputation ever since I was born;
           for which I humbly bless and praise the God of mercy, who
           both made me so and gave me the grace of perseverance.

          </p>
         <p>
           Nor durst ever any presume to make any offers, or the least

          show of an unchaste action towards me; never being allowed
           the least tincture of unbecoming behaviour in my presence.</p>

         <p> But have sometimes lost the favour of persons so inclined
          by my severe behaviour or advice and counsel to servants and
          others that I perceived their inclinations to any immodest looks
          or behaviour,</p>

         <p>

            

           taking more comfort by doing my duty in that  chaste
          course of life then in all the vain follies or blandishments this
           whole life could afford; having been blessed by my God, in that, by the
          prevention of some notorious wickedness of servants by the watchful care and concern I had over their actions.

            </p>
     <p>

         And herein I found the Lord to be so gracious towards me that

               
        
        we had the happiness never to have any such misfortunes in our
          family to have any miscarriage in it; for which I humbly praise
          his holy name and beg always his preventing grace to continue it
          over me and mine, and all that do belong unto us.

         <p>
      The full confidence that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> had in my
      virtuous life gave him so full assurance of my fixed
      faith to him in all its branches, that all the wicked practices
           and odious surmises,

             which some of those made to turn his
            
        [heart]
    
            
          heart from me, I bless God, could never prevail in the least
           thought imaginable (and this he has often declared to
           me his self with great vehemency and zeal).
         </p>

          <milestone xml:id="ev73-start" unit="event"/>
          And, in particular, he declared his abhorrency of <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Anne
        Danby's</persName> abuses, when she set her railing maid <persName ref="ppl:bt1">Barbary</persName>
        to break my heart and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child's</rs> by forcing the lies
           upon us, which was invented to break that match (which lies
        she knew in her conscience was a great falsehood).

          </p>
         <p>
       Upon which noise, when she was persecuting us with slanders,
      <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> did break open the door in the scarlet
       chamber, and did kick <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> down, calling her a most
       base, ungrateful woman to abuse me, <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">his chaste and dear wife</rs>,
       but he would turn her out of <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">his house</rs>. Had she thus requited
      me for my charity, to murder by her tongue not only my
      body by excess of grief but also, if she could, to destroy my
      chastity and my innocency by lying tongues?</p>

     <p>
          But he told her, he would take my part and defend
      my cause against all the world. And did hate all those that
      had such a design to ruin himself and children in the
      distraction of me, and seeking to blast my honour
       and reputation.
         </p>
         <p>
            

           'As for your part' said <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dearest husband</rs>, 'you do

          know in your own conscience that there has been a long time
           a match intended amongst us betwixt <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter,
             Alice</persName>, and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>. And that yourself was the first that
          made the motion in it, as it would be a very happy
           match for us and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">our child</rs>.

        </p>
     <p>
       And would you now be so ingrate and unworthy to
       <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">your poor aunt</rs> as to hear those lies against her, and
          not to stop their mouths and let me and her know who did
          thus wrong us and I shall make them be punished?'

         </p>
       <p>
            

         Thus, when <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dearest husband</rs> had taken my part against her  and defended my cause, finding she had heard of
 
         my slanders about a year ago and still kept it close from me,
          though she had been so much nourished, and kept and maintained
         with <rs ref="ppl:cd4" type="person">her husband</rs> and children above 20 years by me — out of my

         charity and affection for <rs ref="ppl:kwd1" type="person">my sister's</rs> children in distress — yet
          would she not be so good a Christian to discover it by which I might
          have had my wronged innocency

             cleared at the first,
         </p>

        <pb xml:id="page-065"/>






         <p>and my enemies been punished or myself righted. And when she
          was charged with treachery towards me, she still replied that she
          knew in her conscience I was innocent of those things and she also
           knew of that intended marriage and, therefore, she did not believe
           none of them. <persName ref="ppl:awn1">My dear aunt Norton</persName> told her: why, then, did
           she not tell me or <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> how I was wronged?</p>

         <p>

            

           She was the more base woman for concealing these lies from
           me, whereby my wounds was more deep and incurable that had not
           been taken notice of all that time. She deserved death for her great
        wickedness towards me, but she was confident God would revenge my cause upon her and all those which had been so wicked.
            </p>


         <p>
       So, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> immediately turned <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">her maid</rs>
       out of the house and threatened her severely to make her smart for what

           This humble prayers and sorrowful complaints to my

          For <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">this very maid</rs> of <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName>, which she had made
        her instrument to publish my dishonour by the lies they had
           heard, God did show a most remarkable thing upon herself and children; for she, married to one <persName ref="ppl:jp3">John Pape</persName>, had <rs type="person">one child</rs>
           which fell sick of the smallpox like to have died of them, but only
           had them come forth all of one side of all the body, from head
           to foot extreme full, but not one on the other side at all.</p>
         <p> After it was cured of them on the one side, and the child was
        well again perfectly, it broke out of the other side with the smallpox as full as before and <persName ref="ppl:tp1">my brother Portington</persName> had much to
           do to save her from death. This was counted a strange accident.</p>
         <p> But, within a while, <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">this mother</rs> — who had in so vile
           a manner abused myself and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">child</rs> and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> — fell very
        sick of a strong fever and had the advice of <rs type="person">the doctor</rs> and <persName ref="ppl:tp1">my
        brother Portington</persName> and all the means could be to save her
           life, but it would not do. And when she saw she must 
           die, she cried out, to many that was present (<rs ref="ppl:jp3" type="person">her husband</rs>
        being one) that she was damned for what she had done to
        wrong myself and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> in these lies she had heard and
           had reported them though she knew we did not deserve them.
           And she was now damned for them if we did not forgive her.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-067"/>






         <p>And begged of God and us to forgive her and, if we would not
           forgive her, she was damned for them. And it was long of her <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">mistress</rs>
           which set her on against us and, for Christ his sake, begged that I and
          he would forgive her and pray to God to forgive her.</p>
         
         <p>
           After I heard of this sad confession, and yet just one from
           my gracious <quote source="#_2Corinthians_1:3 #BCP,_Prayer_for_Persons_Troubled_in_Mind" xml:id="q-159" type="phrase">Father of mercies</quote>, I could not refrain from giving
          glory to the <quote xml:id="q-160" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_136:26">great and mighty God of heaven who had given hope 
          of repentance</quote> to this <quote source="#BCP,_The_Litany" xml:id="q-161" type="allusion">miserable sinner</quote>, who had done these sins
          with a high hand against us by which God was so much dishonoured
          and our <quote xml:id="q-162" type="allusion" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good names</quote> wronged and her soul endangered.</p>
         <p> Being, also, a clear evidence of the great judge of heaven,
           his mercy to us and judgement upon the wicked: to make <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">this
          woman's</rs> own mouth to condemn her, and to do us right by the same
          tongue she had slandered us to make a public confession of her sin
          and acknowledge her guilt in our innocency and injury.</p>
         <p>
           Which was by the mighty power of God, the conviction of 
          her own conscience, made to confess the truth of her false
           accusation, lies and forgeries against me and him, and that for these
           her sins — against her knowledge and us — God, in his divine wisdom,
           by this sickness and her approach of death, would not let her go
           out of this world before she had cleared our wronged innocency.</p>
         <p> Acknowledging that she was damned for those horrid slanders
          and inventions of the Devil to make us odious before men, when
          her tongue was made use of against those that feared God.</p>
         <p> Therefore, in her agonies, forced to beg God's pardon and us to 
          forgive her and to pray for pardon for her, for Christ his sake, or else
           she deserved and should be damned for her false accusation.<anchor xml:id="ev76-end" type="event"/></p>
         <p> When I was told of this extraordinary way of punishment,
           which the Lord chose to punish her sin and confess his justice therein,
           it could not but work a great terror in my soul to see the
           great reward of sin here and without true repentance hereafter.</p>
         <p> And that the Lord would choose this way to bring her to repentance
           here, that she should not be damned hereafter,</p>
         <p> makes me call to mind the Lord God, his dealing with his servant,
           Job, who had been buffeted by many and great temptations and storms
           by Satan to try his faith and patience under great trials both
           by his enemies, his friends. His own wife — in the midst of his calamities — bid him, '<quote xml:id="q-163" type="direct" source="#_Job_2:9">Curse God and die</quote>'.</p>
         <p> <quote xml:id="q-164" type="allusion" source="#_Job_22-5">His friends accused him of sins and wickedness</quote>; <quote xml:id="q-165" type="allusion" source="#_Job_15:34">called him a
           hypocrite</quote> and <quote xml:id="q-166" type="allusion" source="#_Job_20:5">a dissembler</quote> and <quote xml:id="q-167" type="allusion" source="#_Job_8:13">one that had forsaken God</quote>; all these and
           many more false lies and accusations, did the devil raise up against his righteous soul to make him sin against God and to
           provoke his God against him to destroy him.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-068"/>






            
        

         <p>And of all the calamities fell upon him, we find none was
         more piercing and pungent than what his wife and friends
           had put upon him. <quote xml:id="q-168" type="paraphrase" source="#_Job_2:10">To the first, he answered: she spoke like one

         and shall we not receive evil</quote>?</p>

         <p>
           To his friends' calumnies they charged him with, he answered : '<quote xml:id="q-170" type="paraphrase" source="#_Job_19:21">have pity upon me</quote>, oh, my friends, for the hand of

           and, at length, <quote xml:id="q-172" type="allusion" source="#_Job_42:10-17">did bring him out of all his calamities</quote>.</p>
         <p> He was pleased to justify his integrity against his friends

           Forasmuch as I was, by divine providence, disposed
           in marriage so remote from all my own relations and friends,
           whereby I might be in a suffering condition for the want of
          their advice and assistance either in my temporal affairs and spiritual,
          I was hereby exposed, as a stranger, to the several humours
           of those factious spirits which was altogether fixed — amongst

         <p> All of which had portions out of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> estate of
           about £1500 (besides maintenance and education) and <rs ref="ppl:edg1" type="person">my

           (as I have heard, if ever was paid).

           In this juncture of time was my fortune to be amongst
          them, and how I came to bring myself into it, I have made
           a full relation before (when my marriage was laid in the
          scale to redeem <rs ref="ppl:gw1" type="person">my dear brother's</rs> estate from that
          tyranny of our oppression by the sequestration of all that was a

         </p>
         <p>
           But, since I was thus disposed, it became my duty
          to stand my ground, in a strange place and amongst a strange
           people, and that I was resolved to do — by God's grace and divine
           assistance — never to yield to temptations of either faction.<anchor xml:id="ev81-end" type="event"/></p>

           And though I had so great trouble upon me to defend

           the estate upon them — as I have declared in part in this Book

           So, this continued to my great trouble until by God's great
           goodness and providence, who provides a salve for every sore, did
           look on my affliction with pity and caused <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> (which was
           then our minister by the king's gift
               

            of <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> living) did see

           who constantly preached and baptised, and delivered the Holy Sacrament.</p>
         <p> <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> gave <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> a most excellent character
           of his learning, abilities for God's service and his gifts in preaching,
          with a very high encomium of his worthiness to perform that holy
          function
               

            which, though he was young, yet he was able to perform duty as
         
          ably as those which was much elder.</p>
         <p> When <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> had received this letter of recommendation, it made him more acceptable (from so grave a person as <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName>)
           and much more satisfied, and all the parish, with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> after he
           preached his first sermon (Text: <ref source="#_Psalms_19:7">Psalm 19:7</ref>)
           which he made an excellent piece of work of it, which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and the
          whole parish highly commended and had ever after a great opinion
         
          of him.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-074"/>






            

         <p>The time which <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> sent him to <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> was in
           the year <date when-custom="1663-10">1663, about the month of October</date>.</p>
         <p> After he was received into the parish and preached constantly
           both ends of the day. Besides constant prayer on Fridays and on
          Wednesday, he expounded methodically upon every holiday
          throughout the year and catechised all the children and youth
           in the whole parish (which we had not been used to the good way
          though much desired it) and the youth much improved by his catechising.<anchor xml:id="ev85-end" type="event"/></p>
         
         <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev86-start" unit="event"/>
          At the first he was tabled at <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> at <persName ref="ppl:gm2">George Masterman's</persName>;
            
           from thence, he removed to mess to <persName ref="ppl:xt9">Mr Tully's</persName>, who was much in
           love with his person and preaching; so, continued for some time there,
           which was a great deal of pains he took, in coming from thence
           to <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> so often in a week (being two miles from the church),</p>
         <p> which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> considered to be too much to
           hinder and break his studies. Withal, I have heard him say: it
           
             was a great pity that he was obliged to be with such a kind of
         
          a rude house and too much company, and such as was not so fit
          for him being a scholar and a civil man, did much conserve that his
         
          circumstances should not be better accommodated than he could
           be in that house.</p>
         <p>
           Besides, he — having a value for his learning and parts and
           ingenuity — would make him a very good companion to divert

         
          him in his retiredness and too serious a temper, which he was
          naturally troubled with sometimes when he was vexed about the
          suits and encumbrances on him by that deed of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Mr Norton's</persName>
           assignment.</p>
         <p>
           So, consulting with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> of this affair,
          it was concluded to make the motion from <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
          that he should be invited to come to have his table at
           <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>, which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> would give him with a horse to
           be kept winter and summer, if he would please to come and
          live with him and to perform family duties of prayers and
           catechising the children.</p>
         <p>
           Which motion was accepted of, on both sides, and was
          concluded on betwixt them before I ever heard anything
           of the matter until he was to come by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> order.</p>
         
         <p>
           But I hope, in God, this was so ordered by providence
          that those good offices was performed by his endeavours,
               

             which was
         
           an occasion of a blessing upon this family, and instruction of them
           and teaching them  in the way of piety and religion. <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">My

           reading, study and other pleasant accomplishments, which
           diverted him and very acceptable to his genius, besides the daily
          performances of prayers and reading the scriptures and repetitions of
          sermons. All which things was very acceptable both to God and
           good Christians, with great comfort to ourselves and children.</p>
         <p>
    
          <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Thomas Comber</persName> came to live at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> with <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
           Thornton</persName> about the time of <date when-custom="1665-03-19" datingMethod="#JulianJan">March the 19th, 1665</date>, and so continued (and was here at <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> death) in a painful
          way of studying and reading, improving himself in his studies in
           this retired course of life. And, in this place, he began and finished
          his learned books of meditations upon the liturgy of the
            Church of England (The Companion to the Temple and Altar).
         </p>
         
         <p>
           Which pious pieces of work, I hope God had given a blessing to
          and has been a means to bring in a great number of the dissenters from
           our church, which had so great prejudices against us for it that they
          would forsake our communion, nor by no means would either hear
          divine service but ridiculed, scorned and abused it,</p>
         <p> calling the whole service a dry morsel, cold meat. Nay, popish superstition, and so blaspheming that sacred order of our holy faith and church
           and the holy scriptures
             themselves, which is so fully proved to be the ground
         
          and substance of our devotions compiled into this set form for an
          excellent rule and guide to our public devotions.</p>
         <p> I hope as the benefit was great to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> to begin his first
           years and youth in this, our private family, in which he enjoyed the benefit
           of so early a study and ministry, so the blessing of God will, I hope, go
           along with his endeavours for the general good of souls in many thousands
          and conversion of many enemies.</p>
         <p> So, I hope also, he shall receive the due reward of his labours
           by converting of souls and bringing many to salvation, by the grace of God
          given by his means and endeavours.</p>
         <p>
    
         
           This was also one happy effect of this work begun at our house at
           <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>. That, whereas <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> had been brought up in a way
          of the presbyterian prejudice against this holy forms of prayers in our
           liturgy — and indeed, of all forms but what use in extempore by him
             and others —
         </p>
         <p>
           upon discourse with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, and hearing his questions answered so</p>
         <p>well by him, he put him upon the first desire to hear what he could say
           by way of enlargement upon each of the prayers, which did give him
          so great satisfaction that he ever after had a more honourable esteem
          of our prayers and was willing that it should be used in our family.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-076"/>






            

         <p>And from thenceforth, did never neglect the receiving the
           Holy Sacrament with me at the church in public with the people
           and also in private with me in the house (upon occasion of
          my sicknesses or when we could not have opportunity to
          receive it at the church at our public

           communions).
         </p>
         <p>
           Which we never omitted — since <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> came — to receive it four times in the year, which never had been done before but
           only at Christmas and Easter.</p>
         <p> But he brought them to four times in the year: videlicet, at Easter,
           at Whitsuntide, at Michaelmas (after the gathering in of the fruits
          of the earth to return God our thanksgivings for his blessings of the

           Having been so large upon this subject of having the

           I live, I cannot withhold myself from doing that duty,
          which I owe so much to my heavenly Father — which so bountifully
          has answered my prayers and granted my humble requests in the
           best and choicest of his blessings — which I cannot sufficiently glorify
          his holy name for while I have breath.</p>
         <p> He saw my distress, my fears for my children's being right
           instructed in the ways of true faith and religion, and behold
          the immense goodness of our God, who sees what is fit for me and
          mine, and grants what his wisdom knows fit to bring us to his

      </p>
         <p> And by an unexpected providence for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">both my dear children's</rs>
          right instruction in the true faith of the gospel, and for the bringing
          in <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> judgement to be convinced of his
           error; and making him conformable to so good and laudable forms
          of our most excellent prayers of the church, together with his full
           satisfaction of the necessity of receiving the Holy Communion of
          the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
         <p> Giving us withal the happy opportunity of our children's good
          instruction and our families by prayers and catechising them all

          upon <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, myself and children.</p>
         <p>So that my husband took great delight in his facetious

           About the year <date when-custom="1666">1666</date>, his time was completed. He was to commence Master of Art, going up to Cambridge to take his degree,
           being of <placeName ref="place:Sidn_114">Sidney College</placeName>, where he was much admired and did
          come off with great applause; having been assisted to that work
           by some of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> friends, who was kind and loved him
           for his preaching.</p>
         
         <p> There was much discourse then, when he was at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>, that
          <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> would only leave a curate at <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> to read prayers
           and give about £10<am>l</am> a year to officiate <rs ref="place:Ston_054" type="place">that place</rs>, and so to save
           the £30<am>l</am>  a year which he now gave to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>. (He, giving in all to
          him £40<am>l</am>
           per annum.)
         </p>
         <p> Upon which, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was so much concerned that I heard
          him affirm; if we might not enjoy <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> still and a preaching
           ministry, he would not live at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> but go where he might
          enjoy it elsewhere.</p>
         <p> <date when-custom="1666-06-03">About Whitsuntide, 1666</date>, <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> came to <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> in
           order to receive his tithes then due and brought one <persName ref="ppl:xr3">Mr Roose</persName> with
          him to assist him in that business of the parish.</p>
        
         <p> <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">My dear husband</rs> — finding <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett's</persName> inclination to do as
           before expressed and that nothing but fair terms could do with him,
          and having a particular respect for <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> — consulted with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother
            Denton</persName>, a wise and prudent person, what to do in this case; who, upon mature
           deliberation, judged it the best way to obtain his desire in providing
          for his own satisfaction in that point</p>
         <p> was to see if <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> might be prevailed with to let <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
           husband</rs> a lease of the living for 21 years, or his life to pay him the
           rent of £100<am>d</am> per annum and to find a supply of a minister to preach and to
          perform all duties belonging it.</p>
         <p> They came at length to this conclusion, and a lease to be drawn up
          in order to have the lease to be made in order to a resignation
           of the living afterwards, but <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett's</persName> letter (dated: <date when-custom="1666-06-26">June 26, 1666</date>)
          speaks more at large to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> about it which he was to assign
          over to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>.</p>
         <p> But, being that year's tithes due to <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> then, he would
           not sign a lease until he had that rent of £100 paid to him,
           which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did not know of neither anyone but myself, and <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr
             Bennett</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:jd2">brother Denton</persName> who paid it from me, which I did to a good
          end to obtain the settlement of so good provision for the gospel and
          this family which £100<am>l</am>
           was paid this year (<date when-custom="1666-06-25">June 1666, the 25th</date>) as appears

         <p>After this matter was stated about the living, and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had
           obtained a lease and resignation of this living of <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> (the
          charges whereof was most of it discharged by me), both myself and
          <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">husband</rs> was very diligent and industrious to get the presentation
           granted of the king, who, by the great affection his majesty, <persName ref="ppl:cs2">King
             Charles II</persName>,
           bore to my uncle, my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName>,
         </p>
         <p> he obtained the grant of it for <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> to succeed <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName>
           after his decease, which by God's blessing we did obtain. Indeed, there
          was many obstacles and hindrances met withal in the way to hinder
           it, but at length, by great struggle, the Lord granted to have it
           obtained to the great satisfaction of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> and the parish.</p>
         <p> But, before this business of the living happened, <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>,
           being then at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> and knew nothing of it until, at his return
          home, he called at <placeName ref="place:Sout_116">Southwell</placeName> and was entreated by <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> to bring
          down the lease from him to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>.

          He had received a letter from <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Anne Danby</persName>, who was then
           his great friend (pretended so, however) whose advice he was ever
           inclined to observe, as from a wise and prudent friend; in her letter,
           dated ,
           told him he might, in her judgement, be a very
         
          happy man in a wife if he could prevail to obtain in marriage
           for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">her cousin, Alice</persName>, which was very promising and virtuous. And though
           she was a little too young, yet a few years might work that
           and <rs ref="ppl:awt1 ppl:wt1" type="group">her parents</rs>, having so much respect for him, it might be
           very advantageous for him to settle himself in <rs ref="place:Ston_053" type="place">this place</rs>
          where they would be industrious to promote him to as great
          preferment than elsewhere and much more to this purpose
          (which she had conjectured by discourses from us).</p>
         <p> She, then, having made this motion from herself to
          <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> then as well as long before — that had encouraged him
           to begin this suit, which he had done so long since as when <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my
             children</rs> was at <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName> for to learn qualities (when <persName ref="ppl:ha1">Hannah,
               my maid</persName>, waited upon them, and can witness the same by his
           frequent letters and tokens, and his often treats of them as the dates
           of all those letters may testify to each other and that by my consent)
           — how then, with what impudence and treachery to me and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
          husband</rs>, and these two who she had encouraged and begun this design of a marriage betwixt us all, could she afterwards
           sit as a judge against us in hearing and repeating such horrid
          lies was forged against us and not to vindicate our honours
           against all such, with detestation to resist and stop their mouths,
          by declaring the truth of her knowledge or to have told me
          and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> or <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> of them?
         <anchor xml:id="ev90-end" type="event"/></p>

           Since, then, it was our desire and design to place <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> in this
           living at <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> (thereby to have it supplied by a settled preaching minister, and one whom <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> had pitched upon with a
           further desire to dispose <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">our daughter</rs> to in marriage, if God should
           bless them with life)</p>
         <p>
           this was the true reason which induced me and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> to take such particular care to provide for him; both for
           the comfort we had from his ministry, as also for the hopes of
           future satisfaction by the disposal of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">our dear child</rs> so near us.</p>
         <p>
           And I did not only disburse this £100<am>l</am> to <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> as mentioned but much more monies out of my own particular estate.
          And I was compelled to borrow these £100<am>l</am>  which was to pay <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> his
           first rent due out of <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> for his tithes (then payable at that
           <date when-custom="1666-06-25">midsummer 1666</date>) of my tenants at <placeName ref="place:Midd_038">Middleham</placeName> (which I afterward
          did allow that in the rents, besides the money <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was to
          pay him of £100<am>l</am>  per annum and which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did never pay or allow
          one penny of it, nor anyone else, before <persName ref="ppl:xb10">Mr Bennett</persName> would
           grant to sign a lease to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> in order to a resignation).</p>
         <p>
           Nor did I ever expect any satisfaction for this £100<am>l</am>  or of any
           other monies laid out about the procurement of the presentation,
           or of that concern from <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> or <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> (though it has been
          to a considerable value) hoping to see the comfort fulfilled in that
          good work which God had given me leave to begin for the good of
          many souls, as well as my own family.
         </p>
         
         <p> For the first cause and the last end of all my undertakings in this
           great design — for the establishment of the true faith of our church
           in this place — was
             for the glory of God in the salvation of souls.
         </p>
         <p>
    
         
           And as I have mentioned formerly, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, by God's
          blessing and mercy to me, did join with me in this; having a great
          desire to have purchased the perpetual advowson of this living
           of <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> to annex it to his estate by my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville's</persName>
           means (could have it done for £300<am>l</am>  but <rs ref="ppl:jf1" type="person">my lord</rs> told him it
           would be changed at every king's change, so he laid down that
           design of that).</p>
         <p> But we were very ready to show our endeavours to bring him
           into the way and eye of preferment and, to that end, I made it my request
           to my dear <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName> to accept <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> for his chaplain,
          which he pleased to do for my sake and gave him a confirmation by
           his patent.

          Yet, I must confess, I had no thoughts of disposing of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my
          daughter</rs> so soon in marriage. But then I heard <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had
          been advised to cut off the entail of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> deed a little before his
           going to <placeName ref="place:Stea_052">Stearsby</placeName> (and finished that deed there in
           <date when-custom="1685">1685</date>
            
           and unsettled all
         
          the estate of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> from my children) which put me upon the match,


        <pb xml:id="page-080"/>






            
           

         with great trouble for this alteration, considering since his being
          so afflicted with the

            sad distemper of the palsy, which was like to have killed
         
           him every month with new relapses (notwithstanding all means I
           did use and <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">the doctor</rs>, which was a great heartbreak to me for him).</p>
         
         <p> I could not hope to recover myself of that dreadful sickness I
           had upon me in <date when-custom="1666">1666</date> — by reason of grief I took upon the entail
           being cut off reduced me to a miscarriage in <date when-custom="1666-08">August 1666</date> — having little
           hopes of my own life or continuance of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>.</p>
         <p> And then, if we both should be taken away from our dear
          children, what a condition then might we leave our children
          and estate in, and what a confusion might rationally

             be thought
         
           to follow upon them, our poor posterity?</p>
         <p> These afflicting circumstances obliged my care for all
          of my children and did hasten my closing with this motion
           formerly begun of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, and hoped that by this means — of
          choosing so understanding and discreet a husband for <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my eldest
          child</rs> — he would certainly have a tender care and concern for <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my
            young son</rs> (then but four years old) in his education and principles
           of religion, as well as of his care of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1t" type="group">my two poor daughters</rs>.</p>
         <p> So that, after the discovery of <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> deed being destroyed,
           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> sickness of palsy and my great danger of death as before,
           it hastened the proceedings. And articles of marriage proceeded with
           <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, made with as much advantage as could to secure both
          her portion and other dues to herself and children, together with very
          kind terms for <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear son</rs> not to demand her portion
           until he should be able to pay it, if after <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> decease.</p>
         <p>
           These proceedings in this match, <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> fully knew and was a
          witness to our agreement, and also that I was compelled to advise and
          make <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> privy concerning the settlement of the estate of the
           <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> estate for my children (after <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> was cut off). And
           did send him, as a friend, to consult with counsel for the making a
          new deed of settlement spoken of before, which was the last done before I
           fell sick of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">my last child</rs>; having no friend or relation with me,
          did employ him about all such concerns, which was made a false use
          of against me and my innocent and great business of my family.

            not like a good Christian to justify

           her now, who would not speak for me when she might —

           this plot — to have gained that design to show the world

           who was the main instrument of my slanders, and of
          being set on work of hell to have prevented that good

           have by her means — a second

           For she did, after she was gone from hence, try to
          her utmost to instigate all my good friends against
          me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> by stirring up my good friend <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr

           In the second place, <milestone xml:id="ev98-start" unit="event"/>it was my great joy and comfort — in the

         <p>
           'But <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> is most ungrateful and disloyal to thee: to know

           The third mercy, I humbly acknowledge from my gracious God,

         <p> I have great cause to bless my gracious Father of heaven
           for his immense goodness to me, his poor creature, that


        <pb xml:id="page-087"/>






         vouchsafed me that mercy and providence <milestone xml:id="ev102-start" unit="event"/>in order to clear my
           innocency from all those lying aspersions cast on my good name,
          and was spread as far as <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> to the ears of my dear <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt
            Norton</persName> (who lamented much my misfortune: to have lived to the 42nd
           year of my life in an unspotted reputation and now to be seemed — by
         
           these lying tongues — to have been guilty of something unworthy of
           that noble race and virtuous that I came from).</p>
       
         <p> <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">My dear aunt</rs> was so concerned to hear I had been so belied
           that she immediately came to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and found me in a manner
           half dead with grief, upon this alarm
             that <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">her maid</rs>
         
           raised up against me.</p>
         <p>
               I was extremely overjoyed to see her and blessed God for that 
           providence which brought her thither though, at first, they had possessed
           her with some fears — though never of my giving cause of scandal — that
          I had been unfortunate in lighting upon some treachery from those
          of a contrary judgement.</p>
         <p>
           Indeed, her apprehension had some ground for it — being
           placed amongst so many contrary opinions, who was glad of
           any pretence to make me not so desirable — for those two factions (of
           popish and presbyterian) had been some occasion to choose a match for
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> to secure my children from that education. This, joined
           with others' self-interests, which was contrary to mine, all made up a
          cabal with those of my enemies to take fire and spread my misfortune
           that was raised against me. </p>
         
         <p>
            But then, an inward secret malice of her that should have
           been my compurgator —

             and have done me right by the discovering to me
         
           how I was wronged and in what manner — did not do so, but suffered
          me still to go on so slandered in my own house for two years together , which had been raised upon my securing my writings and money of
           my dear mother's (by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> order) with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> until it
           should please God I was delivered of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">that child</rs> which was my last.</p>
         <p>
           When <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my dear aunt</rs> understood all those bitter pills I had
           prepared for me, she very much commiserated my condition and did
          use her utmost endeavour to find out the injurious practices against
           me, nor would she be satisfied until <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> did quit the
           house of <persName ref="ppl:med1">Madam Danby</persName>. (I have related the circumstances before.)
    </p>

         <p> Her zeal for my honour was truly good, and also to have as many to
           understand the wrong I had been under by such abominable slanders.
          and I bless God for her great pains and industry which she took in that
           affair, who made it her business to testify the truth in my behalf
          against all opposers.</p>
         <p>
           Thus, she played a true Christian's part to me in clearing my wronged
          innocency both to my <persName ref="ppl:xw5">Lady Wyvill</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:xd8">Mr Darcy</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> and 
           my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName>, who had been too much biased by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> stories.</p>

         The excellent comfort, ease and refreshment I received from and

          I have great cause to remember with highest gratitude to my heavenly

           <persName ref="ppl:sg1">Mrs Graham's</persName> coach to carry her, with a maid
         
          to wait on her. I also took my last leave of her and gave
          her other £3<am>l</am>
           to relieve her withal, added to the £5<am>l</am>  I sent before to her,

           which she had then).
         </p>
         <p>
           Beside all the attendance of my house and servants, she
           wanted for nothing I could do for her,<anchor xml:id="evn11-end" type="event"/> though she deserved it not
           to turn so much my deadly enemy — as much as in her laid —
           to despoil me of my precious honour. 
         </p>
         <p>
            But the mighty God of the distressed would not suffer me
         
           to perish in this gulf of sorrow, but sent me relief against
           her, who would have made a prey of me, for to make me still
           keeper after she had thus martyred me.</p>
         <p> <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">
           My dear aunt</rs> did not only give me this comfort

          she observed and heard the matters carried at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>.
           
          Oh, how can I sufficiently set forth the praise of the Lord
           or magnify his holy name, who did not suffer me to perish
          or my innocency to be too long wronged but sent his servant

           then a great concern came in place with me to

           difficulties in childbearing, I was much concerned how to

          of my dear children.</p>
         <p>
           And before I fell sick of <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son, Robert</persName>, I delivered the
           little red trunk of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> — which she kept her writings

           God I was recovered of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">my child</rs> and, then, he restored me them.</p>
         
         <p> But <persName ref="ppl:rc2">my cousin Covill</persName> being dead now and I, far of all
           my relations, was in a great strait who to entrust so great

             being not willing to leave the

         <p> that he would please to take this trunk of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs>,
           with all the writings, into his care and keeping, and to keep
          them for me and my poor children until it should please God
           to restore me again. But, if the Lord should take me away from himself and my children,</p>
         <p> I begged he would please to deliver this trunk (with
           the writings) unto my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName>, who was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs>
           brother and also her trustee and executor of her will and testament.
          I also desired <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> to deliver to my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName>
           these monies, which he had the use of (which was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs>)
           and he had given to me again to keep, but I gave them (being
          about £60<am>l</am>
           or £70<am>l</am>) praying him to give it to my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville</persName> for the

          belong to <rs ref="ppl:jf1" type="person">my lord</rs> as her executor for the use of my children
           as by her will expressed).</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-091"/>






         <p>To which request of mine, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> gave me this
           answer: 'My dear heart, I thank you for being so kind as to
           repose so much trust in me, as to leave the trunk of writings in my
           hand and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">your mother's</rs> money to keep for yourself and children'.</p>
         
         <p> 'But I desire thee to excuse me for having them in my custody,
           the trunk of writings and your mother's money; for though I would do ten
          times more for thee and thine then that comes to,</p>
         
         <p> yet — if, in case God should take thee from me — I would not have
           them found with me because they concern thy children, and some of
           thy friends might think I had altered them or not done right
           to them. And I would avoid all suspicion'.</p>
        
         <p> Then, upon these words, I was much troubled to hear him say
           so, and could not refrain weeping at it, and said: 'Dear heart,
          if you would not keep these things yourself, yet I desire you
           would let <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> keep them for me and my children'.</p>
         <p> But <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> prayed me not to think much with him; for
          <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> must not have them neither, for the same reason
          he did not do it himself.</p>
         
         <p> But he would advise me to leave them all, both the trunk of
           writings and the money, with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> (both the money and writings
          of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> for my children in custody) to keep for me until it
           shall please God to deliver me and restore me again. And if it pleased God
           I recovered, as he hoped I should, then he to give them to me again.</p>
         <p> But, if otherwise and the Lord should take me away from him,
          he did promise me faithfully that he would take care that <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr
            Comber</persName> should deliver all safe into my <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville's</persName> hand, as I desired, which had the most right to keep them as <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> executor.</p>
         <p> When <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had advised me thus, and it was his own mind
           to have me, and I could not prevail for himself or <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>;
           but he ordered it to be so, I said I would do as bid me and give a strict
           charge about it to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, according to his desire.</p>
         
         <p> After this, within a little time, I told him that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did
          desire he would do as much for me as to keep this same little trunk
           of writings, which concerned the estate, and settlement on my children —with all
          <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> deeds and writings of her estate and settlement on my
          children, and the said sum of money of £60 or £70<am>l</am> in a canvas
           bag (which was my dear mother's) also for my children with the sum
           in coin that I desired of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> —</p>
         <p> until it pleased God I was delivered of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">my child</rs> and restored again.
           But, if God should please to call for me out of this world, I desired him
           that he would be faithful to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>, myself and my poor children,
          and deliver all things was committed
          to his charge safe into my dear
         
           <persName ref="ppl:jf1">Lord Frescheville's</persName> hand to be kept by him for the use of my dear children
           according to <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> last will and testament.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-092"/>






            

         <p>And I had also put into the said little trunk a will of my own,
          how to dispose of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> goods and monies to my
           children, according to her power given me by her own will, to
          dispose of them to such children as should be best deserving
           as she ordained me in and by her last will and testament.</p>
         
         <p> According to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> desire and mine to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>,
           he took the aforesaid little red trunk with writings, and the money,
          and did promise faithfully that he would do accordingly to

           said, by casting off its clothes, imprudently caused my sweet
           infant to get a great looseness. And, in a few days, it cost its life

         <p>
           But yet, I must ever give the Lord, my God, all praise and

         <p> Yet since, after this deliverance to me, I received a very

           (as before) by the death of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">my child</rs> and the consequence followed it.</p>
         <p> It pleased God to suffer me to fall into another afflictive
          circumstance which I am obliged to rehearse in vindication of my
          wronged innocency. While I was doing my duty in the securing
           my children's livelihood — as related before, about the writings and
          that money — Satan was busy to undermine my comfort and
           repose. The occasion, which he and his instruments took against me
          to raise all those lies and scandals upon a strict inquiry of all the
          abettors in this tragedy, was the placing of that trunk of writings
          and money in <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> trunk and keeping, which my bitter enemies
           envying, either my life or comfort in this life, raised against me.</p>

           One day, <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, coming down to prayers and dinner, had by
          chance left in hast the keys of his trunk on the table in his chamber
          where he laid and sat at study. It was confessed by the maid servant
           called <persName ref="ppl:mb1">Mary Breakes</persName> (before she went away at <date>May Day</date>, before) but
           kept in secret amongst them in <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">the house</rs>.</p>
         <p> That <rs ref="ppl:mb1" type="person">this woman</rs>, going up into <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> chamber to dress
           it, make the bed (being the housemaid) that she had found his keys
           of his trunk lying on the table when he was gone down to prayers and dinner.
               

         
          <rs ref="ppl:mb1" type="person">This bold woman</rs> had the impudence to open his trunk (but on
          what design God knows) and then she saw in it the aforesaid
           little trunk, which she knew to be <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> and kept in my chamber 
           with the writings (as before) and was mine. And she saw also the bag of
          money with the trunk, judged them both to be mine and that
          I had given them to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> — with the blackest of all ignominy as to
          me — and most treacherously had made the report to tell her companions
            
          what she had seen in the trunk.</p>
         <p> And from hence did arise that abominable scandals that
          I had robbed <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> of his money, and had given it away to
           <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this man</rs>, with many other odious lies and invented circumstances,
          which horrid report had been fostered in their malicious hearts for above
           a year before, and never discovered to me, by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> or any others,
          whereby I might have made the truth public and have confounded
          their wicked lies against my innocency.</p>
         <p> For the business of the marriage of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, was
           both thought and agreed upon long before I had <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">this child,</rs>
           and articles of marriage drawn amongst us, though it was judged
         
          not fit to declare it to any or made known but to only to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
           himself, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> (who was the first motion
           for <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> made of his desire in this point) though for several reasons was to be kept secret yet until an opportunity for it.</p>
         <p> Yet, she knew all the concerns of the estate and could not be ignorant
            
          of these writings and money carried up into <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> chamber by
           the order of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>. And, therefore, the more false and treacherous to
          me, to hear me be wronged in this manner and would join with my
          servants in their forgeries, when it was her duty to have vindicated
          my honest dealings and uprightness of my ways, which she knew
           was but to preserve my posterity when I was gone.</p>
         

         <p>
           If there had been the least tincture of those black crimes true, which
           was by malicious conjectures imagined (that I had been unjust to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
             husband</rs> in anything in the world or by robbing him of those monies
           <rs ref="ppl:mb1" type="person">that woman</rs> saw in the trunk) no wonder they should say I had robbed
           him and he was so low in his estate when I destroyed him in this manner.<anchor xml:id="ev107-end" type="event"/></p>
         <p> But alas, Lord, my God, to thee do I appeal for justice against
          all my persecutors and slanderers that has opened their mouths against
           me. Thou seest my integrity to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>, to thee and all the
          world: let them not prosper in their wickedness,</p>

           and in thy good time make known the truth to thy glory and my

         <p> But, alas, how great a mischief was this unjust calumny
          cast upon my wronged soul, which grieved my dear friends to
           hear and my enemies to rejoice against me, and how small an occasion Satan and his malice can make use of to blaspheme the living
         
           God and traduce his servants: in making a thing innocent in itself to

           And when the story was told to him — with all the bitter aggravation
            
           imaginable, hoping thereby to have instigated him against
           me that they might make their own ends of him —
          that there was my trunk found in <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> with a great deal
           of money, a bag of canvas found in his trunk, <rs type="person" ref="ppl:wt1">my dearest
             husband</rs> cried out, 'Oh, <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my poor wife</rs>!' How base a wickedness was 
           this against her, and how innocent is she to be charged with wronging of him ; for he knew of that trunk and money which was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">her
             mother's</rs> and advised me to put it into <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> custody
          to keep for myself and children when I was going to be delivered of <persName ref="ppl:ct1">my last child, Christopher</persName>. Thus, by the good providence of my gracious Father, the truth was made known to
           <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> and friends' great satisfaction and shame to my enemies.<anchor xml:id="ev108-end" type="event"/></p>
         
         <p> Yet it was the great misfortune of my life — when my unspotted

         
          reputation laid at the stake and mercy of every malicious
           tongue where I could not have opportunity to be soon cleared —
          to make that appear a crime of the highest nature which was acted
          with so great a piety and prudence and affection of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
            husband</rs> and myself for the preservation of my children.</p>
         <p> And though hell and his instruments made the worst use that treachery
           could wrest of it, yet that God, who is so gracious and the God of 
          truth, did in mercy and pity to me did make their own lies and
          slanders to be confuted out of their own mouths and make them
           repent many of them. I bless his holy name forever.</p>
         
         <p>
           And that very money which <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> had in keeping for me,
           for which I was so abused, did <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> know that I laid it out for
           his use and occasions; though it was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs>, he had it all
           freely — so far was I from purloining or robbing of him and taking
           his estate or money from him to anybody's use</p>
         <p>
           that I can make it appear, upon account with him, that
           I had disbursed for his house building and keeping, and many
           other occasions, of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> money and estate above the
           sum of £500<am>l</am> for his debts and children's maintenance, et cetera.
         </p>

        <pb xml:id="page-095"/>






         <p>
           Nor did I maintain and subsist and uphold the family of the
             Danbys (<rs ref="ppl:kwd1" type="person">my dear sister's</rs> children)  for 20 years together out
           of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> estate,  as he did very well know, but what I had
          of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> estate which she bought and gave me to live on
          that was purchased by her widow's estate at <placeName ref="place:Midd_038">Middleham</placeName>.</p>
         <p> (Paying above £600<am>l</am>, the yearly rent, maintained myself and
           assisted me to do what I did for the Danbys and other friends in charity,
           besides my constant layings out for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> occasions.)</p>
         <p>
           Therefore, I may defy the wickedness of all my cursed enemies
          to tax me with the wronging or injury done to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> or his
           estate, or out of it to these ends; doing it out of my own, which
           had given me from God's providence and <rs ref="ppl:aow1 ppl:cw1" type="group">my dear parents'</rs> prudence
          and charity for good ends.</p>
         
         <p> I, indeed, confess I did not lay it out upon any foolish or
           wicked ways, pride of apparel or otherwise evil or wasteful vanity,
          but deemed it my Christian duty to lay little on myself but more
          upon those needful occasions which I thought to relieve others withal
           that stood in need (<quote xml:id="q-230" type="partial" source="#KJV_Luke_3:11">let him that hath two coats impart one to him that
          hath none</quote>); accounting it also my duty to endeavour to support and
           preserve <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and my children with all my fortune by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my honoured
            
             father</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> left me.</p>
         <p>
           Therefore, am I bound in conscience to clear my innocency and
          integrity from all such calumnies as my enemies has cast upon
           me, and with holy Job — in the like case when they wronged him — <quote xml:id="q-231" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_Job_27:5">say
           while I live will I not part with my integrity nor can I justify you</quote>.</p>
         <p> And blessed be the great and mighty God, <quote xml:id="q-232" type="allusion" source="#_1Samuel_16:7">which sees not as man sees</quote>,
           who did deliver his servant, Job, and has in gracious measure done for me,
           his poor, weak and afflicted handmaid. Glory be to his holy name. Amen.</p>
         <p>
           I hope in these things all Christian people will not judge of my
           actions and deportment to be as my enemies would wrong me — and their own
           souls — in believing a lie which none could be counted to be under such abuses,
           but to do (as good Christians) as they would be done unto: <quote xml:id="q-233" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_7:12">to</quote> judge charitably
          and pity my case to be thus traduced by hell and his engines.</p>

           which would prevent the fit 'ere it came.</p>
         
          <p>
           I also begged <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> to persuade with him to stay
          and entreated <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs> to use her best endeavours to work
           with him but to stay one day until he had taken <rs ref="ppl:rw1" type="person">the doctor's</rs> order.
           And I used, with all the utmost reason I could, to prevail with him.
           Telling him, my dear heart, if you should take a fit by the way
           and fall ill, it would danger his life before he got to <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName>.</p>
         <p>
           My own self, so weak then that I could not hope to recover and I did believe I might not live to see him again, and
          would he go and leave me in that condition? And if the Lord should
          call for us both and leave our dear children so young what will
           become of them, with many other sad arguments to persuade.</p>

          <p>
           But he would not hear any of them, saying I loved him
           too much, and bid me set my love only upon God, for should not
           love any creature so as I did him, for doted too much on him
           and God would take him from me; therefore, prayed me to part
          with him freely to my God, for he would call for whom he
          would and I might live to be more useful to his children
          then he could be.</p>
         <p>
           Then he begged that God would please to take both
           himself and me and all our dear children to himself,
          which petition I gave full consent to be freed out of this 
          miserable wicked world if it was his good pleasure.

         But we must not appoint to his majesty what to do with us,
          but leave our times to his divine pleasure for his glory and our
           eternal happiness, still pressing him but to stay until he
           had taken his preventive physic.</p>
          
          <p>
           <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">My dear</rs> still answered me, he would take them at

           prayed me to part with him freely, which request God knows,
          I could not grant when his going was like a dagger to my

         
           heart. But he, having set his heart and mind, was so
           resolved by God's grace he would go, and then I fell into a
            deluge of tears when he said to me: 'The Lord be with thee, my
           joy and dear, and send us a happy meeting if not here
           on earth but in heaven'.</p>
         <p>
           Thus, did <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> take his last farewell of me , and left me drowned in my sorrow  and tears,
           leaving a sorrowful widow behind him.</p>
          
          <p>
    
         
          
           But he told my dear <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName>, who had heard
           of my wrongs and abuses, had come to comfort me in my distress
          and I had entreated her to beg of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> to stay and
          comfort me, and would he leave me in this condition liker to die
           then live? 'No, <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">dear aunt</rs>, do not persuade me to stay, for
           it is for <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my dear wife's</rs> sake that I go.</p>
          <p>
           For, by God's grace, I am resolved to go to <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName> and I
          will be revenged of that wicked man <persName ref="ppl:xt8">Tancred</persName>, who
           hates me and my family and hath persecuted <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my loyal,
          innocent wife</rs> and brought her to her death by his wicked
            tongue, amongst others for aught I know'.</p>
         
          <p>
           He had done justice upon <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">her maid</rs> and
           had turned them out of his house for their slanders, and will
            be revenged of them all and punish them. For he took himself
           abused and affronted and wronged in me and, therefore, would not
          put it up nor would he be hindered of this journey.
           But charged her, therefore, not to tell me of what he said</p>
          
         <p>
           however, not until he was gone for grieving me too much.
          How can I sufficiently mourn and lament the loss of this
           dear and faithful affection all the days of my life, and ever
           to honour his memory; continuing his faithful, true and
          loyal spouse; dear and tender over his children, and
           a faithful guardian to them; and preserver of that poor estate
           he left behind him which, I beseech God, grant me the grace
           and opportunity to testify to the end of my days. Amen.</p>

          bought with <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> money, which ought to have been by
          her will given to myself and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">children</rs> according to her deed
           and will).</p>
          <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev120-start" unit="event"/>
         
           After the solemnity of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs>
          funeral was over, the first and great concern to be done
           was to have the choice of an administrator, to have a good
           and honest person got to do justly in that weighty concern.
         
         </p>
         <p>
           They told me that it, by law, did fall on myself
          as his widow to take administration of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>
           goods and to pay debts, et cetera, by reason there was no will made.</p>

        
         <p>
           As to the making of his will, I had very often put him
          in mind of it when I saw he did so frequently fall into
           those palsy fits, desiring he would please to do it for the
          satisfaction of all the world and that he would please to order
           his debts to be paid as he would have them done.</p>
         <p>
           All the answer <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> was pleased to give
           me was, he had settled his estate at <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> as he would have
           it to pay debts and for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">his children</rs>, and he desired me to see
           his debts paid as he knew I had a good conscience to do.</p>
         <p>
           I told him, again, 'My dear heart, you know there is
           nothing to maintain <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my dear son, Robert</persName>, but out of my
           jointure and estate and, if you leave anything to pay, the
           debts withal'. I was not unwilling to do it but, if they were so
           many and so great, I doubted I could not do it and to
          educate <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my poor child</rs> withal.</p>
         <p>
           So, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did not make any will but what he 
          had said of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> for debts.</p>
          

        <pb xml:id="page-117"/>






          <p>
    
         
           But, after his decease, it was necessary that one should
           take administration to the personal estate, and to order and
          pay all things according to law and to have an appraisement
           of the goods, as the law appoints in that case.</p>
         <p>
           So, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> told me that it was belonging
           to me for to do it and that, if I did not take administration
           myself, I might choose one to take that office upon him.</p>
         <p>
           I told <rs ref="ppl:jd2" type="person">my brother</rs> then that it may be that it did
           of right belong to me, as the sorrowful widow of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
             husband</rs> and, if I were in a condition or capacity to do it,
          I would very willingly performed that office for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
            husband</rs> and pay all things that was due to everyone (as my own
           conscience tells me to do right to all, if it were in my power,
           for the dear and tender affection I have for him and his memory).</p>
         <p>
           But, alas, it had pleased God to visit me with very
           heavy and great afflictions, both on my spirit and weakness of
          my body, so that I did not expect to outlive <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
            husband</rs> long and, besides, I was of so weak capacity and
          knowledge in such things that I did not know how to order
          and manage so great a concern as I ought to do.</p>
         <p>
           And besides, I had <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son, Robert</persName>, to take care of and to bring
           up and educate, with <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">his two sisters</rs>, and the three children now
          was my nearest concern, since the Lord had taken away <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
            husband</rs>. And I determined, God willing, to take the tuition
          of them and to take the best care I could to bring them up in
          the fear of God and educate them the best to my power, if that
          God pleased to bless me and spare my life and health.</p>
         <p>
           After this discourse to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>, he told me that
           some care must be taken of the estate too, and it was well done in me
          to be concerned for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children's</rs> education which was indeed the
           great concern of the family. And if I pleased, because I was
           so weak and could not perform both, to nominate a person who
          might be proper for to take that trust upon him and to act in
          the business of the estate.</p>
         <p>
           Upon this, I told <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> that there was none
            more fit or proper to undertake so great a trust


        <pb xml:id="page-118"/>






            
           

           and act in that concern as himself, who was so wise and
          prudent, and knowing a person in all such affairs and the
          law to act accordingly. Nor no man knew the concerns
           of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> estate and himself and family,
          being so kind and good a friend to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
          and do all things according to equity and justice.</p>
         <p>
           If he would please to undertake that trouble, the
           family would be much obliged to him for it and I, in particular, account myself much engaged for his favour.</p>
         <p>
           But <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> made an excuse and
           said he would serve the family in anything he could, 
           but he could not do that: he was a trustee for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">the children</rs>
           and could not be both (though he was a trustee for the debts too
           as well in that deed of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> as well as for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">the children</rs>).</p>
         <p>
           Then, I said, if <persName ref="ppl:tp1">my brother Portington</persName> would do
           as much as take that trust of administrator on him,
           I should desire he would please to do it for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>.</p>
         <p> But <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton</persName> made the same return for him as
           he had done for himself. So, he left me in a great concern
           how or where to pitch of a right and good man to do it.</p>
         <p>
           At last, he said that if one could be thought upon
           which had not much estate, but an honest man and one of
          an indifferent judgement that would be advised how to
          manage the concerns of the estate, it were better to have such
           an one than have any of a good estate, or were too wise and
          would not be advised.</p>
         <p>
           So, when several was named did not please in one
          point or other, at last I desired him to nominate one,
           who, after a little pause, named <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> <rs type="person">servant</rs>
          who he had caused the warren house to be builded for
           him to live in (having married <persName ref="ppl:ar1">Nan Robinson</persName> what so abused
          me about a great lie she told <persName ref="ppl:tt1">my brother Thomas</persName> of myself and maid, <persName ref="ppl:jf2">Jane Flower</persName>, and had made <rs ref="ppl:tt1" type="person">my brother</rs> ever
           since my bitter enemy against me).</p>
         <p>
           And to please <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, I had granted that the warren
          house should be builded for them to live in, but this people
          was my great adversaries ever after and a great loss and 
          destruction to the estate of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and myself.</p>
         <p>
           This man could neither write nor read and was but

        <pb xml:id="page-119"/>






            of indifferent parts or honesty, not at all in my thoughts
           capable or fit for such a matter of importance of the family;
          so that I was forced to decline this motion as modestly
           as I could and speak my thoughts that, in regard he could
           neither read nor write, he could not understand the business
          nor dispatch anything of that nature.</p>
         <p>
           But <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> did incline to none like him and
          did pray me to think of it because if the debts should come
          too fast on he might plead a plene administravit.

         </p>
         <p>
           The unfitness of <rs type="person">this man</rs> was indeed a great trouble to me,
           being too nimble of his fingers — which I knew and had proof of
           in the house though would not be believed by those proposed him — 
           put me to a great trouble what to do lest their importunity,
           and fearing to displease them, might have him cast upon me.
           So, I would not consent but said I would consider of it.</p>
          <p>
           But behold the gracious goodness and mercy of my God,
           when, in the midst of my distress,
             made a way for me to
          escape the necessity of having such an one to be made a slave
          to. He caused an unexpected providence to fall out, and as
           poor <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> said, 'God had sent me a friend, after my own 
        [heart]
    '.
           And, just as I was in trouble and pouring out my prayers to heaven
          to assist and direct me to one fit for us in this great affair
            — which concerned indeed the right payment of debts and all things
           else about the administrator — </p>
         <p>
           <persName ref="ppl:dcl1"> Daphne</persName>, looking out at the window, heard a horse at the door,
           cried out: 'Oh, mistress, God has heard your prayers and has sent
           you a good and honest man as you desired to help you. And that is
          <persName ref="ppl:an1">Mr Anthony Norton</persName> which is come to see you only as a visit since
           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> death'.</p>
         <p>
           After this good man came to see me, I asked him if he would
           do me the favour to stand for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> administrator, to bear
           the name, and I would take care that the charges should be no
          way troublesome to him but should be paid for his journeys and for
          his expenses, but that he should be saved harmless of anything
          concerning that business. For I was now extremely weak and sick
           and could not be able to travel about it, nor would any of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName>
          friends do it, nor I could not have any stranger to confide in
           like him and hoped that God had, in providence, sent him hither.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-120"/>






            

          <p>
           When this good man, <persName ref="ppl:an1">my cousin Norton</persName>, heard me make my
          request and moan to him, it pleased God to put it into his mind
           and to pity <quote xml:id="q-326" type="allusion" source="#KJV_1Timothy_5:5">my desolate condition</quote>: said, 'Dear madam, I am
          truly sorry for your loss of good <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and wish that I could
           do anything to serve you and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">your children</rs>, but do not
          understand these things very well.</p>
          <p>
            But shall be willing to do you any kindness for your
           own sake, having a great honour for yourself and family.
           Indeed, I have done it once for my cousin <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton</persName>, but
           he directed me in all things and proceedings, and by his order I acted
           and finished that concern for <persName ref="ppl:en1">his son, Edmund</persName>, I hope to his
           own satisfaction and all creditors. </p>
         <p>
            And if you will give me your orders how to act, I shall observe it the best I can or anything else for you lies in my power'.
           When I heard what <rs ref="ppl:an1" type="person">this good old man</rs> said, in a full answer to
          my desire in this business, I blessed and praised my good God
           for his mercy to me in granting my humble petitions, hoping
          this was ordered by his providence for good to me and mine.</p>
         <p>
           I acquainted <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> with this opportunity of my cousin, <persName ref="ppl:an1">Anthony Norton</persName>, being come and of my gaining
               

            
          his assistance in accepting to be <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> administrator
               

            
           which, by reason he knew him to be an honest good man and
           his wife's relation and <rs type="person">uncle</rs>, did approve well of, and so upon
           full agreement about this business proceedings went on. And
           <persName ref="ppl:xf1">Mr Flathers</persName>, being rural dean, came to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> with orders
          to take my renunciation of the administration and my
           <persName ref="ppl:an1">cousin Anthony Norton's</persName> name put in, to whom I gave up my
          power in it.</p>
         <p>
           And <persName ref="ppl:an1">my cousin Norton</persName> took out letters of administration,
           according to law, out of the court and entered bond to the
          court for right administrating as in order of law.<anchor xml:id="ev120-end" type="event"/></p>
          
         <p>
           After this great matter of the administration was settled, it
            was requisite that I should take the tuition of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my
             poor children</rs>, being now, by this great change, become
          both father and mother, and guardian to them. A duty
           which I willingly undertook for their own and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">father's</rs> sake, having
           a threefold tie upon me as being my own, dearly bought in
          bringing them forth by exquisite torments and pains in childbearing, added to many cares and difficulties in their bringing
          up to their several ages.</p>
          <p> As to <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son, Robert</persName>, he was solely left to my charge


        <pb xml:id="page-121"/>






         for subsistence, since there was not out of the estate at <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
            more than what would provide for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">his two sisters'</rs> maintenance
            and portions of  to each, and much less than the value
          I brought to the estate and family, which could not be expected
          by reason of the heavy debts and portions <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> laid
            under to the provision of <rs ref="ppl:ftp1 ppl:etd1 ppl:tt1 ppl:jx2" type="group">his sisters and brothers</rs>.</p>
          <p> Besides, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> having been forced to sell his land
          at <placeName ref="place:Burn_005">Burn Park</placeName> for debts, which was settled before marriage on his
          younger children when <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was then also settled on his
          heir male, but all that did not satisfy for the portions and provision
            for <rs ref="ppl:ftp1 ppl:etd1 ppl:tt1 ppl:jx2" type="group">his brothers and sisters</rs> (with my £1000 out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>
            to clear all debts as before related in this Book).</p>
         <p> But the moiety of the land was fully charged of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>
          at present by a mortgage to <persName ref="ppl:tp1">Mr Portington</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:xr1">Mr Raines</persName> until 
           they were paid the sum of £1600  and all interest due for it.
           For the better security of which mortgage, it was deemed by them and
           <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton</persName> that <persName ref="ppl:an1">Mr Anthony Norton</persName>, as administrator to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
          should make over that rentcharge of £200<am>l</am>  per annum which <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir
            Christopher Wandesford, my brother</persName>, had made to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> at
           his delivery up the Irish estate to <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>.</p>
         <p> He did then make over a rentcharge of £200<am>l</am>  a year for
             until my £1000 portion and the debt of <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName>
          was satisfied to my husband, which he had been forced to pay by
          reason of his taking the assignment of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton</persName> on him.</p>
          <p> Out of this Irish rentcharge, <persName ref="ppl:an1">Mr Norton</persName> gave security to them
          and it was paid to them with interest as it became due and could returned
          by <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>, with deductions for all returns from thence,
          which did take up a great deal of that annuity or rentcharge and
          was a very great loss to me and my estate.</p>
          <p> As for the moiety of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, out of which <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">the children</rs> was to
            be educated and have maintenance, all public charges and assessments
            was to be paid and interest for debts out of that part for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">the children</rs>, as it
            was ordered by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">their father</rs> in that deed. So that, for several years
            together, I received not towards <persName ref="ppl:ktp1">my daughter Kate's</persName> maintenance
          or for her education the sum of 20 shillings or of 10, though she should have
            had equal with <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">her sister</rs> after £40<am>l</am>  a year to each of them.
            But I did borrow for her, keeping several years that I wanted out
            of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, and never had it made good to me as I ought out of that land,
            that is still owing to me the sum of

          <p>Where then could there be anything to bring up <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my only son,

         <p>
           All which was so burdened with public charges and debts, which
          I was forced to contract upon several accounts fell on me
          that I had great straits, which I entered on upon <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>

          <p>As for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1">my two daughters</rs>, there was to have been £40<am>l</am>  a year for
            each out of the land of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> to maintenance, but such
          was the great taxes, assessments and all public charges after
            <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> death, with the payment of interest for debts,
           that it fell much short every half year and some years
            was very little to be had, so that I had great difficulty to live,
          as well to maintain my own family, pay interest for those
            debts (so contracted as to keep <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my son</rs> which I had solely to
            provide for) without borrowing.</p>
         <p>
           Which cannot be imagined but reduced me to great straits,
          entering into this widowed condition at first with debts
           and my estate at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> which was most of it in <persName ref="ppl:eh1">Elizabeth
             Hickes's</persName> hand. She paid no more for all <rs type="place">the park</rs> and upper ground
           but £28<am>l</am>  a year, which, after she was gone off, I made of that very
          grounds in my own hand by stock and gates near 
          £150<am>l</am>
           per annum.
         </p>
          <p> Yet, having undertook this charge upon me, I did my

          children</rs> with a tender regard for them both in sickness and in
            health. And I hope none of them can say they wanted anything
            was fit for them in all conditions, and I hope, I may, with a
            good conscience, appeal to my gracious God that I made
          it my duty to serve him in the performance of my paternal
            care over them whom he had put into my hand, with all due
            affection and prudence, and to correct their sins and instructing them
            in all duties of piety and religion.</p>

            the best where she would, and if I pleased I should have one.</p>
         <p> I thanked him for his advice and telling of it. I knew it was
           my right and due, as I was his sorrowful widow but, in regard
          there was so many and great debts of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> which
          could not be scarcely paid, I would deny myself of that

           in my own wrong (if I had meddled with them and made myself

           After this passage, before the appraisement begun, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my good

           I did not know as much, but he thought fit to tell me of it,
          that he knew <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> had given me her personal estate
          and goods by her will and testament.
               

         </p>
         <p>
           But, whatever was so given to the wife will fall due to
           <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, my husband, and by the law nothing which was so
           given to the wife but did fall due to the husband; for the 
           property was in him and not in the wife (being under covert baron)
           and, therefore, all <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my lady's</rs> goods and personal estate would
          fall due to be appraised amongst the rest of his goods as his was.</p>
         <p>
           Upon which discourse I was much surprised to hear this
          sad news, which it had been all along harped after as by <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Harry
          Best</persName> betraying me to that which they would have had by his false
           deed. But I bless God, I was aware of it and did not sign it,
           but now the bottom was laid open; it being all along a
          design
             to have had the property of her estate to have paid his
           debts, which was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my blessed mother's</rs> intention to secure for myself and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="person">children</rs> which she foresaw would be left poor enough.</p>
         <p>
           But after some pause,
               
             I gave him thanks for his 
          kindness in acquainting me with the matter of law in this thing
          and particular and withal though <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs> has given her estate
           and goods to myself and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="person">children</rs> as I see cause, yet
           rather than just debts should not be paid, I would quit
          my right in them. If I must not have them according to her
          deeds and last will and testament, I must borrow a bed for
           myself until I could buy one (this being a surprisal
           to me, at that time, to have her will so broken).</p>
         <p>
           'But, Sir, I must now let you know the reason why <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my
             dear mother</rs> did settle her estate personal in that manner';
          she has done to prevent what she otherwise see might come to

           That <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs>, having advised <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> against
          taking upon him the assignment of <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton</persName> as very
           pernicious for him and his estate (such troubles in the
            
             managery

          knowing that the deeds and last will and testament did sufficiently
           secure both his interest and her own.</p>
          <p>
           But that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would not take her advice
           not to meddle with <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton's</persName> assignment —
          but by acting in that business contrary to reason and her judgement
           and interest in the Irish estate and his own,<anchor xml:id="ev128-end" type="event"/> <milestone xml:id="ev129-start" unit="event"/>and foreseeing what
            ill consequence it would be of —  
          </p>
          
          <p>
            she did then resolve, by the best counsel she got, what
          way she had best to take by law for the securing all her personal
          as well as real estate that she might preserve and secure it for
           myself and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">children</rs>. For she said, <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, by acting in
           that affair which did not belong unto him, would certainly
           involve himself and estate into debts and suits with <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>
            (who expected that estate as heir) and charge his own estate with them,
           though there was ten times more of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> then would pay all
           he owed, and all gifts, portions and legacies.</p>
         <p>
           This made her foresee a great deal of trouble and encumbrances
           to fall upon <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> by those transactions, even to the endangering his own estate by engagements. She told me often,
           why should I want a bed to lay my bones in and <rs type="group">my children</rs>,
          which she feared on the former account would be taken from us
           by debts (which needed not having brought so fair a fortune).</p>
          <p>
           Upon these considerations, she had, by advice of an able
           lawyer, made a deed of gift to feoffees
           in trust of all her
           estate, personal whatever — which schedules
             annexed of her goods to such
           purposes and intentions use and dispositions as therein mentioned — </p>
         <p>
            for to secure it to myself during life and, at my death, to such
          child or children as I should see best deserving.
          Still the property to be kept in those feoffees in trust and not to be made
           liable to any other use, as debts and other inconveniences, as consequence to the assignment.<anchor xml:id="ev129-end" type="event"/></p>

           Moreover, she said his taking it upon him had lost her the

          after <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> death to <persName ref="ppl:cw2">his son Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>.</p>
          <p> But <persName ref="ppl:rd1">my uncle, Richard Darley</persName>, would not let <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother</rs></p>

          all <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> writings and deeds which settled that
           point, with the deed of gift and her last will and testament.
           He, having read them, was much surprised and said that he had
           never seen them before. (But I thought I had showed them to him
          when <persName ref="ppl:hb1">Harry Best</persName> drew the deed for me to sign but I told him of

         <p>
           And then, he said that <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my lady's</rs> goods could not be
           touched and that he had never seen anything better done in his life,
           and that the property was not in <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, nor could they
           be made liable to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts or disposal (the property
           not being in him but the trustees). Which, when I heard him
          say so, I had the more cause to bless God for, which had in 
           mercy so provided for me — by <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> blessing and

         <p>
           But I will praise and bless and magnify the name of the

          heart thus to provide and preserve these few things in comparison
          to all her great estate she had been wronged of. The Lord make me
           <quote source="#BCP,_Prayer_with_Thanksgiving,_Fifth_November" xml:id="q-329" type="phrase">truly thankful</quote> for this particular mercy to me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my orphans</rs>.

            
           O Lord, I pray thee still to help and assist thy servant out of all
           evil designs that are against me, thy poor widow, and make me have a

          only was enjoyed by the virtue of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> wise disposal

            to have bought — as I was forced to do — without that I had

            that  I bought them with <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> money and ought not
            to be appraised and pleaded they were all hers, bought by me and
            paid for of her money. It was quickly answered me that
            her money being converted into goods, and they not expressed
            in her will and deed of gift, did fall to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> part
          and so must be appraised as his.</p>
         <p>
           Which goods I so bought and paid for, came to the sum
            
         </p>
         <p> But if I had had any relation or friend with me that would
           have stood up for the widow's right, either law or equity
           things must not have gone so, but I, alas, had no uninterested
          person to assist me in all these occasions and I was left desolate
           <anchor xml:id="ev132-end" type="event"/>
          only from what heaven was pleased to give me his helping
           hand, for which I return his holy name praises forever.</p>

           Therefore, I esteem the mercy of God was very great to me
            that poor <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> was here with me, at this present, when the
          appraisement was made because I had none in the world which did
          know which was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> and which was <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> good but
            she. So, she went into the house along with them and showed which
            was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> beds and other goods in every room belonged to her:
            for she knew all the marks and had marked most of them.</p>
         <p> And for the pewter brass and all else could be done was her name set
           on them before her death who, like a wise and prudent parent, did
           thus to prevent any disturbance might fall out afterwards.</p>
          <p> When <persName ref="ppl:rg2">Robert</persName> saw that <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> did own that most of the
            household goods to be <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs>, by the marks and <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne's</persName>
            testimony to them: 'What', said he, 'we shall have at this rate to
          be <persName ref="ppl:aow1">my lady Wandesford's</persName> that is in the house; here is little or none
            for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> then'.</p>
          <p>
           To which <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> presently returned answer again: 'Sir,
           if I were called to my oath, I must take it that what I say
           is true concerning these goods. They are all <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my lady's</rs> and all of
           them was set down in an inventory before her death by her order',
           and she (seeing them done before her own self and was appraised all
           after her death) 'which is to be yet seen, I believe, in <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my mistress</rs>, her keeping, </p>
         <p>
            and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> had not a bed or any household goods in

           had from <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my lady</rs>, and she gave them to <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my mistress</rs> to use. But not

          After this, the appraisers went on with their work and when
          they come to the scarlet chamber they
               
             valued the bed and
            the hangings of it, with the stools and chairs (six of them) with the
            counterpane, rug and blankets, and a little ordinary bed which was
          bought by us. The rate was set on them to be by <persName ref="ppl:xd3">Mr Denton</persName>
          of <placeName ref="place:Nawt_072">Nawton</placeName> to be worth £40<am>l</am>
            and so set it down in the appraisement.
         </p>
         <p>
           At which, <persName ref="ppl:tt2">Thomas Thompson</persName>, judging it to be very high and above far the worth of it, came to <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> and myself and
          told me that he was against it and did speak his mind, but that
           <persName ref="ppl:xd3">Mr Denton</persName> of <placeName ref="place:Nawt_072">Nawton</placeName> said he was an appraiser at <persName ref="ppl:xg1">Mr Gibson's</persName>, when
           <persName ref="ppl:jg1">Sir John</persName> died, and they had a bed which was not so fine a colour nor made
          so fine a show which was appraised higher.</p>
          <p> So, after, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> came into my chamber and
          said he doubted they had done amiss in overvaluing the scarlet bed. I asked, what the rate was set on it? He answered, £40<am>l</am> 
            but doubted it was too much.</p>
         <p>
           Upon which I told him, I should be glad it would give as
           much and since I desired to buy the goods and pay for them again,
          rather than expose them to a more disgraceful view which was
           a dishonour to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>. But if they could make that money
           of that bed, they were welcome to it for I could not give it.</p>
          <p> And I could make it appear by <persName ref="ppl:xb13">my cousin Beal's</persName> notes, who
            bought the goods at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>, that all she bought for that sale did
            but cost £25<am>l</am>,  so that, if they was so appraised and I had paid so much
            before of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> money, I had better never own them.
            It would ruin me to pay so, and I would not have it.</p>
          <p> On which <rs ref="ppl:jd2" type="person">my brother</rs> went out again, after I told him
            to answer the objection of <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton's</persName> about <persName ref="ppl:jg1">Sir John Gibson's</persName> bed. I
            knew it and had taken good notice of it, being a very rich hand-silk, damask bed with all answerable to it of the same and a large one;
            the bed being a noble down bed, with bolster pillows, blankets and
            all suitable which I am sure was never bought for £60<am>l</am>,
             so that £40<am>l</am>  for
            it was an indifferent price for that.</p>
         <p> But mine was but a serge bed and what belonged to it but was
           a light colour, made a show, but that would yield no such price.
           After this discourse, I suppose, they fell off that price was set
           when they heard I could not meddle with it at that rate.</p>
          <p> Yet whatever rate was set on that and the great parlour too
            was very unreasonable, having bought and paid for them
          before, which yet out of my love I had for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> family
          I was content to do, though I borrowed every penny of it and paid
          his debts with it. And I know we had not one cow for milk
          but what was <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> and the sheep was bought with her

           Before I pass to another subject, I think it but fit to give an
          account of a very material accident which fell out for me to struggle
          withal in the first month of my widowhood, which though I
          had been given some notice of by my good <persName ref="ppl:xf4">Lady Fairfax</persName>
           sometime after <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> was returned from <placeName ref="place:Scar_045">Scarborough</placeName>.</p>
         <p>
           Videlicet: she coming to see me one day, it happened that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
          dear husband</rs> had been in a fit of the palsy and was ordered
           by <persName ref="ppl:rw1">Dr Wittie</persName> to have a bath which I made according to his direction.
          <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">My Lady</rs> just came when he was in it and had been prettily
          recruited while he was in the bath and would have had me gone
          to <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">my Lady</rs> while he was in it. But I durst not leave him so
           long, only stepped to <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">her Ladyship</rs> and told her which she would stay
          until had laid him safe in bed after it.</p>
         <p>
           Which I did and went down to <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">my Lady</rs> again, which <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">good
           Lady</rs> did much pity my condition, asked me did I not
          hear anything of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> making a bargain when
           he was at <placeName ref="place:Scar_046">Spa</placeName> to sell all the wood at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>.</p>
         <p> At which news I was much concerned and said, 'No, <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">Madam</rs>'.
          She prayed me then not to be troubled at it but assured me
           it was so and <rs ref="ppl:xk1" type="person">some base fellow</rs> — taking advantage of his illness
           in his head sometimes — had got him in an humour and had
           made him sell all his wood he had, and at a pitiful rate as she
           heard. And was very sorry for it; therefore, she came on purpose
          to let me know that I might take some course to save it.</p>
         <p> I returned <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">her Ladyship</rs> humble thanks and had saved the wood
           several times and should be very sorry to live to see it destroyed;
           so, <rs ref="ppl:xf4" type="person">my Lady</rs> went away and left me in much concern

             lest he might

               

            
           cut it down sometime or other, but durst not own it to him.</p>
         
         <p>
    
         
           But now, after <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> death, there comes a man
           called <persName ref="ppl:xk1">Kendall</persName>, a wright, and cuts down one of the best fine oak
           trees in the park, without acquainting any with it. Afterwards, he
           comes to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> telling him that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, when
           he was at <placeName ref="place:Scar_045">Scarborough</placeName>, had sold to him all his wood at <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> and
           at <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, for a considerable sum of money and taken of him
          twenty shillings in earnest of the bargain.</p>
         <p>
           And he now came to have his bargain performed and had
          witness of it, and could make it good, and he had cut down 
          one of the trees in the park as part of the bargain and expected
          it should be performed by me for all the rest.</p>
         <p>
           <rs ref="ppl:jd2" type="person">My brother</rs> told him he never heard anything from <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
             Thornton</persName> of it in his life and did believe if it were so he should have
           told him. Besides, the estate is now in another hand, and he
           was sure I — to whom it did belong now — would not grant that
          the wood should be destroyed. And he was mistaken to think


        <pb xml:id="page-131"/>






         he should have liberty to cut a stick down, and was questionable
           for what he had done. But he would let me know what he said.</p>
         <p>
           When <rs ref="ppl:jd2" type="person">my brother</rs> told me this matter, I then called to 
          mind what my <persName ref="ppl:xf4">Lady Fairfax</persName> had told me and feared it was
           too true, but how to preserve the wood I was desirous to consult
           with him; telling him that, by the grace of God, he should never have

            
           his design to destroy that beauty of the estate as long as I lived.
           I loved it and had preserved it thus long, and <rs ref="ppl:xk1" type="person">this man</rs> was
          a knave to take the advantage of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> to draw
          him into a snare in his weakness.</p>
         <p>
           In conclusion, we had much to do to break this bargain,
           and I utterly refused, and threatened to punish him for the trespasses
           he had done to come into my ground to do it. So, at last, for
          fear I should question him for it, <rs ref="ppl:jd2" type="person">my brother</rs> advised either
           to give him the 20 shillings <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> had received, or to give him the
          tree he had cut down.</p>
         <p>
           But <persName ref="ppl:xk1">Kendall</persName> would have both; so, to be quit of a knave and to
           quit  the bargain, I paid him the 20 shillings and he was to make
           me a discharge — under hand and seal — to renounce all his title
           claim or demand to the same bargain of the wood forever. And
           this tree which he had was valued to be worth £5 or £6<am>l</am>.
         <anchor xml:id="ev133-end" type="event"/></p>
         
         <p>
           Thus, by the good hand of providence to me, his poor servant,
          was I delivered from this great evil of destroying this
           benefit of the estate and I hope to preserve it for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>
           posterity. I, ever making it my endeavour to increase the wood
          by planting and letting young trees, which if I could have secured
          as well as I would — or as I have done to all the plane trees
           or sycamores, which I brought from <placeName ref="place:Hips_022">Hipswell</placeName> and nursed them
          in the orchard until fit to set in the rows and walks in the front
           of <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">my house</rs> — there would have been in the park and elsewhere
           many hundreds than ever was cut in my time. </p>
         <p>
            For I ever took a delight both in the ornament of
          it as well as the pleasure and profit of it on any land.</p>
         <p> Therefore, will I bless and praise the Lord, my God, for his
          great mercy in preventing so great a loss to fall on me and
           mine as this would have been, and in giving me his help to
           prevent such a wickedness as <rs ref="ppl:xk1" type="person">this man</rs> would have done to
           <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> in his weakness (which I am sure he never
           would have done in his perfect understanding and health). But
          I will never forget to praise our God for this mercy and all else
           showed to me since I was a widow, and in <quote xml:id="q-331" type="phrase" source="#_Psalms_23:6">all the days of my
             life</quote>, for his preventing grace and providence. Praise the Lord forever.
          Amen.</p>

           After this appraisement was made, and they had rated according
           to their judgement, it came to the sum of 
            with what was bought with <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> money and her stock
           and cattle (which <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> bought but never paid for them) was all 
          it came to 

         </p>
         <p>
           But, in regard that there was some which was so cross
          towards me to judge that the appraisement was done in favour to me
           — because I was to buy them off the administrator to pay the debts —
           <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> and myself considered it was best to prevent
           scruples to have a second view, and a new appraisement done by
           some others in different neighbours, and have them appraised again
           which was done by my desire. And so there was <persName ref="ppl:xm4">Mr Morrett</persName>
             and
            was desired to do that kindness for us, and what they
          did rate the goods and whole inventory at I was willing to
           pay at the full value for them; offering them, if they pleased to
           get them sold for that they were now on the review
           set at,
          which was 
         </p>
         <p>
           I would give more; being unwilling the house should be
           dismantled and exposed to sale in a public manner to the dishonour
           of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> (that it should be said, he died in so
           much debt that none of his friends or me, his wife, would undertake
           them for his credit or <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children's</rs> cause).

           So that, though I was reduced to so low an ebb in my

           suits (upon the former account given in this Book and in my

           The charges of whose education, being of many years'
           continuance, must be entered hereafter under each of their
          names in a proper place; consisting of many and several occasions

           As to the education, maintenance and learning of <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my
             dear son Thornton</persName> will amount to so prodigious a sum as
          perhaps may not be credited. But it was the great concern
          of my days, how to find supplies for him when he was to go
           out abroad to the university, in order to make him a scholar
           to which he was designed by God's grace and his own choice and inclination, and my sacred vows to Almighty God if he would please
           to grant my humble petition of a son, as his servant, Hannah,
           dedicated Samuel to the Lord.</p>
         <p>
           Even so did I dedicate <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my son</rs> to the service of the Lord,
           if he would vouchsafe to grant me that blessing, he should be given
          to my God to serve him at his altar and ministry of his holy word
           and gospel. To which petitions the Lord, my God, did please to
           say, Amen. And, in his due time, gave him that happy opportunity
           to preach his gospel and, I trust in his mercy, he became an instrument
           of saving souls. Glory be to the <quote xml:id="q-332" type="phrase" source="#_Genesis_24:7 #_2Chronicles_36:23 #_Ezra_1:2 #_Nehemiah_1:5">Lord God of heaven</quote> for his
           infinite providence and calling him to that faith and way of salvation.</p>
         <p>
           But, before this great concern came to be in agitation
           of <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my son</rs>, very many transactions and great occurrences fell
           out for me to act in this world; my life being full of various and
           great changes, whose remarks must be taken notice of by me in
           order as they happened. In all which, I am obliged abundantly
          to take care to render my humble thanksgivings for all his
           infinite providences and mercies showed to me in a singular manner.

           For although I was upon these, and many more accounts formerly
           mentioned, forced to make use of my friends' kindness and to borrow
           many sums of money to discharge what I was creditably obliged;
           yet, it pleased God so to order things to be some comfort in the
           midst of my sorrows and sufferings, I found many good
          friends which was willing to lend me money.</p>
         <p> Some upon my own single bond: videlicet, as my <persName ref="ppl:kc1">lady Cholmley</persName>
           lent me £50<am>l</am>;
           my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> lent me £100<am>l</am>;  <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> did
           procure for me £50<am>l</am>. All which I took as a high favour from God
           to assist me until I got them in some time paid, with due interest.</p>
         <p> But I could not compass the greater sums I had need
           of without some friend to be bound with me, so was forced to
           have a friend to be joined with me (though I remember <persName ref="ppl:jh4">Mr John
             Hicke</persName>, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> old friend, did lend me £150<am>l</am>  of my own
           security which is all paid with due interest long since, I bless God.)</p>

         <p> But it was a very pushing
             consideration to me that I was
          forced to enter the first concern of my widowed condition with
           bonds, debts and engagements for others, whereas I brought so
          considerable a fortune and never knew what debt was to others
          but what I had been serviceable to many in necessity to lend for
          charity. But it was the good pleasure of my God to bring me
           into this dispensation; therefore, do I humbly beg his mercy
           and grace to endure it with patience, and to bring me out of
          debt and that I may <quote xml:id="q-333" type="partial" source="#_Romans_13:8">owe no man
           anything</quote> (as St Paul saith)
           <quote xml:id="q-334" type="paraphrase" source="#_Romans_13:8">but love which is the fulfilling of the law</quote> <quote xml:id="q-335" type="phrase" source="#_Romans_15:30">for Jesus Christ's sake</quote>. Amen.

         <p>
           All the time of my great sorrows and piercing calamities,
           I laid in my sorrowful bed, being overwhelmed with one
           trouble after another, which so depressed my heart that
           it was next a miracle that I could be supported (having
          that pungent trial of the unjust slanders and abominable lies
           cast upon my chaste and untainted reputation).</p>
       <p>
           And, as if all conspired to destroy me with a second blow, this
           was not enough. But on my renewed repetitions of my remote
           enemies, still my miseries was raised up afresh, like <quote xml:id="q-336" type="allusion" source="#_Job_1:14-15 #_Job_1:16 #_Job_1:17 #_Job_1:18-19">Job's messengers, one after another</quote>, which again repeated fresh quails of sighs
         and tears, ready to swallow me up
      </p>
         <p>
            for the dreadful loss of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my most dear and precious 
          husband</rs> stuck me to my heart who helped to bear me up in all
           my sufferings. This was a doubled calamity. Both to lose the joy
           of my life, and the blessing of my life taken from me by the devil
           and his instruments in the comfort of my good name to be so
          blasted for the performance of my duty.</p>
         <p>
           Added to this, the weak and sick and fainting of my
           spirits, which was ready to sink under each moment and to make
           a separation betwixt my soul and my body; while I not only laid
          under spiritual afflictions but bodily extremity, loss of almost
           all the dearest concerns of this life, together with great burdens
           of debts, troubles, and great and heavy burdens to undergo in the
           managing of an estate which was ready to swallow me up.</p>
         <p> So that I had more than ordinary afflictions on my
           weak spirit all at once, which did so work on me that I had
          no way to fly from them but only to cast myself down
           at the <quote xml:id="q-337" type="phrase" source="#_Hebrews_4:16">throne of grace</quote>, mercy and divine assistance. For none
           but Christ could support my miserable soul; he, <quote xml:id="q-338" type="phrase" source="#KJV_Malachi_4:2">who hath healing
          under his wings</quote> to help, relieve, heal and support me under
           these calamities and make me to endure the fire of these sufferings, until
          he has purged away my sins which makes me unworthy of his
           mercies, and that <quote xml:id="q-339" type="partial" source="#_Romans_15:30">for Jesus Christ, his sake</quote>. Amen.</p>

         <p> But still I must lie under the hand of a gracious God
           and merciful Father, who has wounded me, and he can heal
           either by means or without, as he in wisdom sees fit, to make me 
           to perform my duty to his majesty and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my poor children</rs>; for
           whose sake and provision, I have been suffered to fall into the hands 
           of the wicked. And I hope his holy majesty will see fit — in his
           good time — to vindicate my cause to clear my innocency and
          to prosper all those honest endeavours and designs for the good
          of this poor family.</p>

         <p>
           In this letter of <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne's</persName> to me, she tells me that she came
           away from me and left me so weak and sick in bed, yet there
           was a providence in her return home; for <milestone xml:id="ev138-start" unit="event"/>my dear <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt
             Norton</persName> had discoursed with her concerning my affairs, and had
          heard how all my troubles increased by the envious malice of
           <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName>, being turned out of <placeName ref="place:East_019">my house</placeName> by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> before
          his death for her wrongs and abuses of me.

      </p>
        
       <p>
           But though she had vowed to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and herself — that, as
        she had never seen or known anything evil in or of me in
           her life, so she never would repeat or report of anything of that 
        nature she had heard from others but would vindicate my
           honour
             as long as she lived —

               

         </p>
         <p>
            yet now (contrary to her oaths to herself and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
             husband</rs>) she was so full of malice against me and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
          that she had made abundance of stories up to <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName>
           against him (because she could not prevail to break the
          match with <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> and to have had him married with
        
           that <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName> she brought to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> to break this match,
           and have <rs ref="ppl:mb2" type="person">that woman</rs> to have him and would have lived with them).
      </p>
       <p>
           She, having gotten <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> to dine with her at <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName>,
           had so far prevailed with him against <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> that he,
           good man, was imposed upon by her cunning tongue to get
           my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> (my near and dear kinswoman and <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter,
             Alice</persName>, her godmother) to be incensed against him for some
          misdemeanour of his to some person (but cleared me)
      </p>
         <p>
               that it was not fit <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> should be married to
          him, and that <rs ref="ppl:ps1" type="person">the doctor</rs> would come with <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs> to break this
           match, desiring <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs> that she would go with him to do it.
        
        But <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my dear aunt</rs> answered that she would not go to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>
           until <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> came home, which would tell her the truth of what she
           knew of all things if she saw any motive in him that he did
           not carry as a wise, sober person. But if he did so, as she saw no
           other cause to believe, she would not design to prevent it
           which might, if it please God, prove a happy match for her
           (he being so great a scholar and ingenious person).
      </p>

         <p>
           But <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> did hear that there was a conspiracy betwixt
           <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> and my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> that my
          <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> was resolved to come over to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> in order to
           prevent; that the match should be broken and that she would
           come to pretend to have <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, with her to <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName>


        <pb xml:id="page-141"/>






           (under pretence of having her to be confirmed)
             and so to
          have prevented the match to go forward. This <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my dear
            aunt</rs> told <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>, upon which <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> did inform me of it,
          and said all those which was my friends and sincerely wished me
          well did advise me to put an end to this long-designed match
            
          which would make them despair of breaking it.</p>

              And she designed to come over to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> the next 
          week and do me what service she could but in the meantime to
           be very careful of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>: for it was intended to steal
          her away and all contrivances was laid out for it.
           <anchor xml:id="ev138-end" type="event"/>
         </p>
       

         <p>
           Thus, I had more bitter pills prepared for me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear 
             child</rs>, who Satan set all his tools on work to undermine my
          comfort in the disposal of a comfortable husband for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my child</persName>,
           and for the happy education
               
             and instruction of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">all my children</rs>
           in the true faith of our church, which had been my great endeavour to establish ever since I came into this family.</p>
     
         <p>
           If <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> had known any ill thing by <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>,
           why then was she so false and treacherous to me — her only friend
           that had relieved and kept her and hers for above 20 years, at
           most, of my poor patrimony <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> gave me for my
           relief and <rs type="group">my children</rs>?
      </p>
       <p>
           Which, if she had known what was not fit for me to marry
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> to him, why would she then be so false to me and 
           mine to betray us to such an one and advise us to it, and so have
           made us most miserable, when it was her duty to have told
           me? And she knew, in her own conscience, that I had told her
           upon these reports that if she knew anything of him, or if I
           could be sure he was guilty of any such which the slanders
         had spoken and laid it on — whom denied it on oath which I had made
         enquiry of —
      </p>
         <p>
           I did protest solemnly, as a Christian, I did so much
           hate all tendency to evil, that I would first go with my
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">dear child</rs> to her grave before I would marry her to any such
           which was guilty of such odious things and that I would break that match.</p>
         <p>
           To which she,  seeing me in such concern, did vow she did
           never see or hear any immodest thing from him and did not
           believe any ill thing of him. And if she did, she would have
           told me of it.</p>

         <p>
           (Since then, <persName ref="ppl:mb1">this woman</persName> had made so full a clearing of him
           to me concerning his being wronged and my own concern.)</p>

       <p>
           Or how dares one, under the notion of so pious a person as
           she was accounted, make no more conscience out of a private
           end to blaspheme the honour and reputation (both of myself
           and <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">a man</rs> she so doted on) to have had him matched to
           <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName> and that she knew was so much scandalised, 
      </p>
         <p>
               yet still now to go on in her perfidious treachery to
           both to me (an innocent creature) and to make her private
           ends out of others to abuse such good persons (my friends)
          and bring an eternal blot on our injured persons and
          <quote xml:id="q-340" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote>?</p>
       <p>
              But still Satan is at work to ruin me in
           all the comforts of my life; <quote xml:id="q-341" type="allusion" source="#_Job_1:6-12 #_Job_2:1-7">as he followed up against Job</quote>, so
          doth still raise and stir up my dear and kind friends to
           make them be turned my enemies; for when he could not
          prevail against me to make <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> my
           enemy — nor ever had the least misgiving thought of me,
           as he ever did own to me and all my friends in my distress, </p>
      
         <p>
            though <persName ref="ppl:acd1">this Danby</persName>, he did say, would have tempted him
           to it, but he hated her for it and would not endure her tongue —
           now Satan, by her works with that instrument to ruin my repose
          and rest in a good conscience, has prevailed to incense my
          friends and has set my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> on
           work to begin a new persecution of me, and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child</rs>,
          by hanging
             and forging of slanders against <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> as the
          only speedy means to prevent that lawful marriage.
      </p>

         <p>
       
           To that end, I received another kind letter from <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my
          good aunt</rs> in making some great remarks of my great
           sorrow to be beyond the bounds of what I ought, for none can believe
          me to be so fallen off or degenerate from those pious principles
           since my infancy; yet, I ought not to be overwhelmed with it,
          <quote xml:id="q-342" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_Romans_8:33">for God's mercy was so great that he would not lay anything
           to his elect: who then can charge them? It is Christ that justifies</quote>.
      </p>
         <p>
           After which, she assures me that she had come to see me and
           give me some comfort in my great distress now, in my concern
           upon me as to the disposal of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, some other way 
           to satisfy all the world in my proceeding; to be wise and discreet,
           and that she heard <persName ref="ppl:xs7">Mr Scott</persName> had some who would be proper (as
          she heard) which would compose the business in hand.
           Thus far, good woman, she went as to the breaking of our match.
           
           
          To which I returned answer that if I were anyway </p>

         conscience
           to myself, or of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, his deservings to be
          as our enemies has devised slanders on purpose to destroy
         my comforts in my own innocency and in his — for aught I
           ever see to him in his behaviour since I knew him — 
      </p>
         <p>
               I should not put my friends to any trouble to propose
          any medicine to put an end to my afflictions or this match
            (which was to begin so long since and upon such good and just
           consideration, having an eye first for the honour
           of God in it). 
         </p>
         <p>
              But should be more zealous to prevent proceedings
          than the whole world could be, as my nearest concern to my
          spirituals and temporal for the establishment of the faith in
           my family. And this is my chiefest joy to have, and grief to
          forgo, without greater cause than all our enemies' inveterate
           inventions to destroy my life and honour, goods and good name
          altogether with one blow.
      </p>
         <p>
              But I trust and rely only on the mercy of our gracious
           Father of heaven, if it may be for his glory, the church's good
           and my family's support, he will grant a blessing to our design
          as I have very often supplicated heaven for his direction
          and will depend upon his providence.

           After this letter to <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs>, poor, honest <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>
           writ me a second letter to let me know she heard how much
           I was grieved and afflicted, with sickness and extreme sorrows of
           all kinds, and was troubled that my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> had been with me
          and had brought me into greater sorrows.</p>
         <p>
           Which <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> was grieved for (that she was come to torment me
           and not done me no good but hurt) and prayed to God to comfort me.
          She had hired a horse to have come immediately to me to 
           <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> to have told me <milestone xml:id="ev143-start" unit="event"/>the cabal was so great that <persName ref="ppl:xd8">Mr
             Darcy</persName> was for turning <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> out of <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">the house</rs>, and my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady
          Yorke</persName> for coming to forbid the match herself, or if she could
           not break the match, she would steal <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> away.
      </p>
         <p>
              But my friends did advise by all means to wish <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>
           to let me be married and then they would be content, but my
          <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> often inquired when it would be that she might
           prevent it, but none could tell her for they knew not of it.</p>
         <p>
           So, <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> begged for God's sake and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my poor children's</rs>
           sake to have care of my own life, for they were ruined if
          that by too much pressure on my spirit I should die, and withal
          to take care of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child</rs> who they laid at wait to
          take from me by stealing her from me, and when she came


        <pb xml:id="page-144"/>






            
           

           she would give me a fuller account of all intrigues (which was done
          by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> instigation of <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> and from him
           to my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName>, who was so deluded against <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
          that she would not be so kind and Christian to me as to come
          and acquaint me with what was informed against him,
          but rather to take this cruel way to rob me of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear
            and eldest child</rs> without cause but an incensed malice).
      </p>
       

         <p>
           But when <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> went home, she did vindicate
          <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> cause and clear those ignominies cast on him which
           was invented to ruin my poor family. Good God, what can
           not a witty, lying tongue work of mischief, being set on fire
           of hell? I beseech thee, O Lord, to forgive them and punish the evil
           doer which has hatched all this wickedness from hell. Prevent all
           those wicked designs against those that are thy servants, and
           <quote xml:id="q-343" type="allusion" source="#KJV_Romans_8:28">do thou bring good out of evil for thy mercy's sake</quote>. Amen.
      </p>
         <p>
           Oh, direct and go along with all our honest designs, bless
           our endeavours for thy kingdom and the good and comfort of
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child</rs>; make her an instrument to <quote xml:id="q-344" type="allusion" source="#_Genesis_3:16">bring forth
           children</quote> that might increase thy kingdom and be a 
           comfort to me, thy poor, oppressed handmaid, <quote xml:id="q-345" type="partial" source="#_Romans_15:30">for Jesus
             Christ, his sake</quote>, and to convert all my enemies. Amen.
      </p>
       <p>
    
         
           After this, <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> came the second time to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>
          and found me so very weak still on the new sorrows and
          calamities brought on me by the false accusation of this
           woman, <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName>, and the incensing of <rs ref="ppl:ps1" type="person">the doctor</rs> and my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady
          Yorke</persName> to have utterly discarded and broken the marriage
           with <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>. It was, indeed, very bitter to me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my
            dear child</rs> to be done in so vile and scandalous manner
           from such false instigations.
      <anchor xml:id="ev143-end" type="event"/>
       </p>
       
       <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev145a-start" unit="event"/>
         
           But <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, valuing his honour and vindicating
           the same, having this belief the design was from <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> —
           who solicited him for <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName> — did make so full proof of his
           wronged innocency and, being very earnest to have the business
           concluded, desired me to take those true friends' advice that 
          knew the state of all things amongst us.
      </p>
         <p>
              And by the grace of God to let the marriage proceed with
           what conveniency of speed and secrecy we could, and he did
           not doubt (if, please God, he lived) would make it appear by
          his life and conversation to confute all those odious scandals
           against him. And that, if I pleased to give consent, he might
          enjoy his long-desired happiness in <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> in marriage
          that she should live as comfortably and as happy in a 


        <pb xml:id="page-145"/>






           a dear and affectionate husband, as if she had married to a
          great estate; for riches could not make one happy without
          the grace of God, which he humbly begged to guide and go
          along with him in all his ways.</p>
         <p>
           I told him withal (as <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> said when
           he asked his consent to have <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> in marriage) that
          though he had a kindness and good opinion of him before another and there was no haste, she was young enough and did
          not think of marrying her so soon. It were better to stay a
          while longer until she were in years more accomplished.
      </p>
         <p>
              And it was not my judgement to bring her too soon
           into the married estate (being so hazardous in bearing children)
           and should be greatly afflicted if, upon so early a marriage,
           she should have her life endangered which would be the most
           saddest thing that could befall me.</p>
         <p>
           To which my objection, he did believe it might be so
           indeed to me, so indulgent a parent, but did faithfully
          protest to me that he had so great and tender an affection
           for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Mrs Alice Thornton</persName>

           above all the world, that he would
          not for his own life hazard hers in that kind but preserve
           it by all means possible, nor should not desire children
           until it please God she was more capable without danger.</p>
       <p>
           And another argument he used: that whereas he
          had set his desires and affections so on her virtues and deserts that
           he had denied himself of the proposal of <persName ref="ppl:xs5">Dr Stone's</persName> (<rs ref="ppl:xs6" type="person">his daughter</rs>)
           which had £1500  portion (and several others forsake) so, he did
           believe, if I should be taken away by death (which God forbid)
          that her seeming friends would strip him of her and he
           never should obtain his so long desired happiness. 
      </p>
         <p>
            And he saw under what affliction I lay in, which made him
          doubt very much my illness should prove dangerous and so
          begged of me to grant his request.</p>
         <p>
           I told him upon his former assurances and that I should
           advise with my friends in this concern, which was so great to me
           as the disposal of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my eldest child</rs>, and begged the assistance of God
          to direct me for the best.</p>
         <p>
              And withal I did expect the full performances and agreement of those articles, long since drawn by him, to be drawn in
           form of law, with his bond for performance to establish all her
            
           fortune upon <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> and her issue, male or female, with other
           clause for the benefit of <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my dear son, Robert</persName>, her brother.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-146"/>






            

         <p>
           To which he answered that he was not only willing to make
           the best assurances I would, or he could of her own fortune,
           but was resolved, if ever God enabled him with an estate, to
          settle all he had upon her and hers.</p>
         <p>
           And this very promise he made to <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford, my
             brother</persName>, soon after his marriage, which <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName> told
           him he did expect of him, 'because, Sir', said he, '<rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my niece</rs> marries
           you to a great disadvantage to her; she having a present
           fortune and born to a partition of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">her father</rs> as next heir to <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">her
             brother</rs>, we shall expect this from you'.
      </p>
         <p>
           To which discourse <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> did positively answer: he
          would do all that her friends thought fit in this particular and
           did find himself in honour and conscience to perform by the grace
           of God.</p>
         <p>
           After the assurances given to me (as before mentioned,
          as well to <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> as myself) and upon the news
           that <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> brought of some designs to prevent it, and my
           own daily weakness increasing, fearing I should leave all <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my
            poor young children</rs> in a very unsettled condition by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">their
          father's</rs> death and infinite debts to fall upon the estate.</p>
       <p>
           Besides, when both father and mother are both taken away,
           those children are in a forlorn condition for tutors or governors,
            guardians or true friends to take care of them. And here
           was a providence offered; by the disposal of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my eldest</rs>, all the
         other I might hope for would be taken care for </p>
         <p>
            (by leaving <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son, Robert</persName>, in the hand of a good and wise
           and learned man, who would by God's blessing see him brought
          up in our faith and gospel, and able to instruct his younger and
           and riper years in our true Church of England, according to
          my humble petitions to heaven in his behalf).</p>
         <p>
           All these great things considered, I was the rather more
          inclined to grant to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> request that I might
           see this good work done before I died, which I had daily cause
          to prepare for and expect by my daily torments and lies
          raised against me to cut my days off.
      </p>
         <p>
           So, advising with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> in the case and making him fully acquainted with the endeavours to take <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs>
           from me, knowing all the wrongs and injuries done to me by
          <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Danby</persName> and the rest, as also of the concern of marriage from the
           first motion, upon all these reasons did join with
        us in our
          affair and was willing to draw up and engross all those
           terms, articles and agreements before marriage to which <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr
          Comber</persName> had


        <pb xml:id="page-147"/>






           freely and fully consented to, and drew up the first
          draft of those articles with his own hand when he
          had first hopes of this marriage.<anchor xml:id="ev145a-end" type="event"/></p>
       

         <p>
           Therefore, how false and abominable was those scandals
           imputed by hell and his instruments, which said I was forced to
          marry <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> to hide my own blame or dishonour.</p>
         <p>
           But, O <quote xml:id="q-346" type="allusion" source="#_Acts_1:24">thou, great searcher of all hearts</quote>, the God of
           truth, do thou, O Lord, confound all those wicked tongues
          and imaginations which has laid such odious things to
           my charge, and defend my cause against <quote xml:id="q-347" type="allusion" source="#_Deuteronomy_13:13">all the sons and
           daughters of Belial</quote>, and do thou justify thy poor servant

             that they may be caused

               
             to confess their wickedness
           to thy glory and their own conviction. O my God, be gracious
          to thy weak handmaid and make me have some comfort in
          the resurrection of my <quote xml:id="q-351" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote> <quote source="#BCP,_Burial_of_the_Dead,_Psalm_39" xml:id="q-352" type="partial">before I go hence and be no

           forever. Lord, hear my petitions and let my cry come unto
           thee for the <quote source="#BCP,_General_Confession,_Evening_Prayer" xml:id="q-353" type="paraphrase">Lord Jesus Christ, his sake</quote>, which was scandalised for
           my sake. Oh, <quote xml:id="q-354" type="allusion" source="#_James_5:11">let me endure with patience the chastisements</quote> which thou hast
           laid upon me and sanctify all thy dealings with me; I humbly
           beg, in and for the sake of thy dear son, the Lord Jesus, my saviour,
           in whose name and his prayer I call on thee, saying: '<quote xml:id="q-355" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_6:9-15 #_Luke_11:2-4">Our father, et cetera</quote>'.
      </p>

       <p>
              Having upon mature deliberation with the advice of
           my true friends, consideration of the aforesaid reasons,
          accepted of the motion of this marriage, with the full consent
         of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child</rs>, who — considering my own circumstances
           and the condition we were reduced into in the estate by <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">her
          father's</rs> debts, and my great and exceeding weakness I was brought into by all my griefs and sorrows by death of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> and the horrid slanders raised to prevent this match,
           and that I was nearer death than to live with <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs>, </p>
         <p>
               she also considered into a worse state they might be in
           afterwards —
            did very wisely choose to cast herself upon the
          providence of our God for direction in this great change
           and, with myself, humbly begged his blessing and assistance


        <pb xml:id="page-148"/>






         to go along with us in this concern: that it might be ordered
          by his wisdom for the good of her soul and spiritual concern
           and comfort for this temporal life to her; that he would
          incline her heart to accept of <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this person</rs>, which may be a 
           great instrument of God's glory in this church and for a 
          continuance of this family in the name and fear of God
           and to establish the true faith in this, <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs>, and if
          it were his pleasure to make her an instrument to <quote xml:id="q-356" type="allusion" source="#_Genesis_3:16">bring
          forth children</quote> that might be heirs in the kingdom of
           heaven. And all this for the Lord Jesus Christ, his sake, our
           dear saviour, we begged in her name and for his glory,
           saying as he hath taught us in his gospel, '<quote xml:id="q-357" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_6:9-13 #_Luke_11:2-4">Our Father which</quote>'.</p>
         <p>
              After we had poured out our petitions to God at
           the <quote xml:id="q-358" type="phrase" source="#_Hebrews_4:16">throne of grace</quote>, he was graciously pleased to return
           an answer to us, and so ordered all things so as, we hoped,
           would tend to his own glory and our comfort, which was more
          speedily intended to be performed by general consent
           than was before resolved for; instead of those, which was our enemies, to prevent it by private designs of stealing <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs>
           from me, the grief of which did enforce me to hasten it.
      </p>
         <p>
           For the sooner my death might come, the greater was
          the argument to me to have her disposed to one who did
          make all professions imaginable to be most faithful
           and careful of all <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs>, and to do all acts of love
           and care and concern for them (both for the good instruction
           of their souls and education, and their bodies and estate).</p>

       <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev146-start" unit="event"/>
         
           So that <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>, coming over to me, told me
          all the intrigues was amongst such as was set against
           me and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, did advise and encourage me to prosecute
         this concern with speed, because I was so weak and afflicted
         to get it done, that I might have some comfort of her before
         I died. And it would be a great happiness to have all <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my
          children</rs> placed with so good a sound minister of the
           church of God, which was the greatest motive I had in 
           this world for fear they should be otherwise educated.
      </p>
         <p>
           Thus, what our enemies used as a means to break
           our good designs, God, our gracious Father, made it the more
          speedy to bring it to pass, and we were willing that he
          should go to <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName> after <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> came to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName>.
      </p>

        <pb xml:id="page-149"/>






       <p>
           That <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> should go to <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName> to procure the 
           licence to marry <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, which day was on
           the <date when-custom="1668-11-05">fifth day of November in the year of our Lord,
             1668</date>. I hope it being done of a most eminent day to our
           Church of England — being that very day in which Almighty
          God did show his miraculous deliverances of all our souls
           and bodies (with the whole church of God in the Christian world)
          from that Gunpowder Plot of the bloody papists for our
           utter ruin and subversion when we had cause to rejoice 
         <anchor xml:id="ev146-end" type="event"/> — </p>
       
         <p>
               I hope in God it may prove as prosperous, blessed and
          happy to the good and establishment of the truth and
           light of God's gospel to be established and preserved in this
           my poor family and blood. And shall be confirmed in me
          and mine as long as the world endureth and for the salvation
          of all the souls that spring from <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> and myself, which will be the great blessing I humbly crave of God
           for the Lord <quote xml:id="q-359" type="paraphrase" source="#_Romans_15:30">Jesus Christ, his sake</quote>. Amen.</p>
       <p>
           And, instead of abolishing, to establish the truth from
           all sects, schisms, heresies or popery or profaneness whatever,
          because <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this man</rs> had set himself to write so many
          learned and orthodox books to vindicate our religion and the
          truth against all falsehoods, he had contracted many
           enemies against him; as well as, I hope, he had been a 
         means to convert many. Yea, very many from the 
          errors in their life and doctrine,
      </p>
         <p>
               which works of his in the church is of more value and riches
          to it than if he had built great and rich edifices and given
          much endowments to its temporal advantages.</p>
         <p>
           For although those are of great honour and esteem that
          are great patrons to the church in any kind, yet it is of
          more glory to God and advantage to the souls of men to 
           be a means of salvation to poor, sinful souls and to
          bring many to righteousness.</p>
         <p>
           So that, though we could not say we married for the riches
          of this life and glorious estate here — indeed this was not my
           thoughts to do so which, if I would have so chosen, I might
           have bestowed <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> so (for her having opportunities
          to do it in our nigh neighbourhood) —
      </p>

        <pb xml:id="page-150"/>






            

       <p>but I may appeal to God that my choice, and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
         husband's</rs>, was so <quote xml:id="q-360" type="allusion" source="#_Luke_10:42">to choose for the better part as Mary did</quote>,
         which shall I hope never be taken from me or <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs>
          forever. This is my ground and bottom on what I ever desired
          to fix both in my own choice of a husband for myself
         and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2">my dear children</rs>, and I hope I have found a greater
          joy in my own soul in my choice than all the worldly
         riches could afford and so, I humbly trust, shall do for
         all <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my dear children</rs> whom God has given me.
      </p>
       <p>
           And, although all the world shall condemn me, yet shall
           not my heart condemn me since God is on my side. </p>
         <p>
               And though self-interest shall blast my honest designs
          with false glosses and horrid imputations, <quote xml:id="q-361" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_91:2">yet in God is my
          trust and in him will I hope for deliverance</quote>.</p>
         <p>
              Though malice, hatred, spite and the instruments of
          hell torment me and stirred up my near and dear friends
          to judge rashly (fear I have done amiss) yet will I not
          part with my innocency, virtue, hope, and confidence in
          my great Creator but that he will please to vindicate me
           in his blessings upon my <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="person">children</rs> (though I desire patiently
           to suffer what he pleaseth to bring me to for his holy name's
           sake that I might see what joy this great work of his
           gospel established in my generations). Glory be to him forever
           and ever more. Amen and Amen.</p>

              There was many lies and stories set abroad still to deter and distract my soul, and to prevent this happy design of
          this marriage. As that before poor <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> came over when
          they heard about <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> that the marriage was intended my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName>, which was her godmother, being incensed
           by <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> from <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Anne Danby</persName>, did protest she
          was resolved to come over herself and use all the means
           she could to prevent it. And that, being her godmother, she
          would either get her away under pretence of having
          her confirmed by <rs ref="ppl:rs2" type="person">the bishop</rs> or to use some means to catch her
          from me in secret when she was walking abroad.
      </p>
         <p>
           But <rs ref="ppl:dcl1" type="person">this poor, honest woman</rs> had notice from <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my
             aunt</rs>, which was set upon to come with <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> to force
           me to break this serious and holy unity, which I had been so long
           in bringing to pass for the foresaid reasons. Thus, have I been tormented by the spleen and malice of hell by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> work.

           But God, having designed a blessing for us, I hope, did
          not let all their stratagems prevail but prevented them

           So, after some preparation for this marriage, the
          writings and deeds which <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton</persName> had engrossed and
          made ready with a bond of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> for performance
          of articles and deeds being entered into for security of her
           fortune. The bond was for —

         <p>
           Dated: <date when-custom="1668-11-17">November 17, 1668</date>. Witnesses –

       <p>
           <persName ref="ppl:cm2">Mr Charles Man</persName>, the minister of <placeName ref="place:Gill_105">Gilling</placeName>, was entreated to do this kind and friendly office for us to join

             Thornton</persName> — in the holy bond of matrimony
      </p>
         <p>
           which was performed in a very decent and a religious
           manner. I, myself, being all the friend she had to stand
           for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">her father</rs> (whom God had taken from us) and gave her
          in marriage, which I could not refrain to shed many tears
           considering how I was left, and she, in a manner, forlorn of all
          our relations who should have been our comfort in this great
          of our change.

         <p>
              <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">
                My dear child</rs> did carry herself most virtuously and
            modestly, with chastity, in this holy action into which she did come
           and with tears entered into it; begging a blessing of God to his holy
           ordinance we both did, and to which, I humbly bless his holy name,

            
          I hope he gave a gracious return of our prayers.
      </p>
       <p>
          There was witnesses of this sacred marriage being done in the

         chamber: <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne Lightfoot</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:ha1">Hannah Ableson</persName>
          and <persName ref="ppl:ml1">Mary Lightfoot</persName></p>
         <p>
           which, because it was done in so much secrecy by reason
           of our adversaries' malice, it was not thought fit to have any
          more witnesses for making it public
             sooner than it was convenient to be known for several reasons.</p>
         <p>
           But indeed, I was, with <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>, very desirous and earnest

          marriage, or to have been a witness of it at least. But
           I do not know very well on what account, but for reasons
           best known to himself did desire to be excused to be there, but
          said he wished them much happiness and joy in their
           marriage. So, we had not his company at that time.</p>
         <p>
           I suppose that the rest of <rs ref="ppl:tt1 ppl:jx2 ppl:etd1 ppl:ftp1" type="group">the brothers and sisters</rs> was
          never well pleased at the disposal of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs> in the
          way of marriage for several reasons, and one main one may
          be that the more of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> children had children
           the further off the estate would be of descending: as it has
          appeared since <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my dear son Thornton's</persName> decease without
           issue and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1">the daughters</rs> saved. (There was £800<am>l</am> to fall to them.)</p>
         <p>
           This business was transacted with great gravity and piety.
           After which, <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> and myself went to prayer to beg a
           blessing and mercy upon our great undertaking, and though it was
           began with great sorrow and affliction on my part, I hope —
           and put my trust in the living God — he will be merciful to
           me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child</rs>, and let us receive the comfort of his
          presence to preserve us from all evil and bless us with all good

       <p>
           <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">The bridegroom</rs>, as in those cases, laid down a

          as a token of his faithful and conjugal love to <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">his dear

           After it pleased God the marriage of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>,
          was perfected and all our
         affairs was ended, I had

              I feared <rs ref="ppl:gl1" type="person">her husband</rs> would be displeased at her

           no less for all her service in this and all the concerns she
           had for me to right my wrongs, and to go to my friends to give
          them a true account of my actions, whereby they found how
          much injury I had laid under and was very sorry for
           so rashly giving ear to <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> stories, and said it was
           only malice. And she did show them all the letters which passed

           Also, the occasion of that acceptance (of my most sad condition by grief upon the cutting off the entail) and forced
           me into a miscarriage and flood on grief on it. I then did
           look for nothing but death and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>, so often relapsed into
           the palsy, could expect not long to live. On these great things,
          both myself and <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">husband</rs> did consent to a marriage with this
          <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, which was judged a great scholar and able
          divine and a good husband.
      </p>
         
         <p>
    
         
           So, that being the occasion he was made use of to go upon

          me when I laid in of <rs ref="ppl:ct1" type="person">my last child</rs> and all that followed of the

           <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName>, <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Uncle Norton</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">Aunt</rs> heard, they was all
          very much troubled for my false slanders laid on me for doing

      </p>
         <p>
              And whereas they were all my enemies and <persName ref="ppl:tc1">my son
                Comber's</persName> before, they, by God's mercy, was turned to pity me
           for all the great afflictions laid on me and prayed for me. And said
          they were glad that <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> did bring them this account of the
           business and <persName ref="ppl:mn1">my uncle Norton</persName> said, 'If they were married,
           God speed them well and send them a happy wedding'.</p>
         <p>
           But told <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>, why would I not let them lie together?
          She said it was done by their own consent that being not to be
           made public until a while after, and then they was to lie together.



        <pb xml:id="page-155"/>






           So, after <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> went home, it pleased God — by her true
          and honest account of my actions and of the good carriage
           of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>,<anchor xml:id="ev153-end" type="event"/> I bless God for it — all that was my true Christian friends, without partiality, was very joyful and glad
          and thanked <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> for her great kindness and duty to
          me.
      </p>
         <p>
              Nor did she deserve less at my hand. Not knowing
           how greatly I was obliged to my God in the first place, who
           is my Creator and preserver and author of all good to me,
           to whom be all glory, honour and praise forever for his infinite
          favour to me in giving me <rs ref="ppl:dcl1" type="person">this good woman</rs> to vindicate
           myself from those wrongs the devil and man had raised.</p>
         <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev154-start" unit="event"/>
         
           I did give her, for herself, as a token of gratitude,
          a young cow and calf to sustain her house with other good
          things which she had deserved for her faith and fidelity to me and
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my poor children</rs>. And sent <rs ref="ppl:gl1" type="person">her husband</rs> a Bible and 1 lb  of tobacco.

           After her going home, I received letters from her and <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs>
          which gave me great comfort. For <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> had informed <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my dear
          aunt</rs> of all proceedings and how I was compelled to have the
          marriage sooner solemnised in regard of my own sickness
          and weakness, which I foresaw was very necessary to be done.</p>
         
         <p>
           For if I should have been taken away from my family,
           all things would have been in an utter confusion and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my
          children</rs> would not have had any to take care of them or
          look after debts, but those whose interest was to pay none or
          was it indeed to be expected from those who was to succeed
          as heirs in the estate. And this was the main reason, as to the
          preservation of both temporal and spiritual concerns of this
           my poor, desolate family, solely destitute of friends or advice
           or counsel when all the load fell on my shoulder to bear,
          which was ready to sink under the heavy hand of God.

         <p>
              After <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> had made a full relation of my sad condition

          family to support it from ruin — by the continual clamours and raised
           slanders (both before and since this happy match) because they failed

         <p>
           it pleased my gracious God and merciful Father to look on

           church and my children, and so sincere a cause) to make me to
           find some pity and compassion amongst my own relations,
           who had been stirred up against me by malicious enemies,
            
           who was enemies to the church of God and hated me for his sake.</p>

           But the gracious God, who did withstand his malicious

           But, in infinite and miraculous mercy, turned <persName ref="ppl:mn1">my uncle Norton</persName>,

         <p>
               and did show great sorrow for my sad afflictions and was

           from me and ignorant of the sad condition my estate is now in —

          at present my own small jointure — </p>
         <p>
               if I choose rather to consult in these cases with those who
           know how all matters stands. For though I value them for the nearness of relations and believe they sincerely wish us well, yet,
           except they could be informed how my temporal concerns are,
          they cannot be apt judges of my actions, which I can demonstrate
          to any unprejudiced person to be for the temporal as well as
           spiritual good of this family. And I should be very sorry
          any of my dear friends should censure me for acting for

           the true state of my condition and affairs — with those sad circumstances I am unjustly and maliciously fallen into, to preserve myself and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">poor children</rs> from ruin — you would be so far from
          censuring my actions that you would both pity me and

           After the writing of this letter, it pleased God I heard not

          me and my condition and
             to quiet the spirits of those that was
           stirred up against me, and by degrees was more patient since they saw
          there was nothing but innocency and virtue followed by us.</p>
         <p>
              And those that was so much stirred up by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> malice
          saw there was nothing but that at the bottom, which was blown up to
           make me and mine miserable if they could, but that God of mercy had
          still the over-ruling power over them and made many of them repent
          their rash belief and ask pardon for it.

           make him very sensible what wrong he had done to me and what a

           But, as the wounds of the body are not so soon healed, nor the scars

           be soon healed, but the poison longer continues before it be drawn out,

              And can these great, deep and dangerous wounds of this

           continuance, so inward and secret, not to be discovered until by its
           rankling and putrefaction, its pain and smarting, it is discovered to the
          wounded person when the occasion is gone or the serpent fled that
           did it? No, no, the wounds of an open enemy are sooner discovered,
           and the wounds sooner healed, when it is laid open to the eye and some
           speedy applications had to stop its going farther, and so the hurts are quickly cured. </p>

           in him,
            and flies to him for refuge, and relies only on Christ and
           his merits for pardon, healing, strength against sin, the world
          and the devil. And thus is Christ received by every true believer.

              Having been thus blessed by God to have the Holy Sacrament
           brought to my house in my great weakness, which I so longed after,
           I found much comfort in my spirit, and was hopeful I should,
           by his grace, be enabled to go through this wilderness of sorrows
          when I considered that my saviour had suffered so much for
           me and suffered more than I could endure for him.</p>

           There was many occurrences happened to me of a fresh supply of
           trials before I could be enabled to get by my sorrowful bed,
          which was of many occasions, <milestone xml:id="ev159-start" unit="event"/>but since it pleased God to give
           me this opportunity to receive the blessed Sacrament — with <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my

           much comforted in God's mercy. This being the first time I could
          be able to do it since <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> death which was in

              After which I was compelled to enter into bond for several
          sums of money to some that took my own single bond to pay
          those debts and funerals which was imposed upon me.</p>

           <milestone xml:id="ev161-start" unit="event"/>
              It pleased God about <date when-custom="1669-01">January</date> to enable me to get out of my
           bed, though very weak, yet by his great mercy, who gave me being
           and preserved me with life, did enable me to do it (though much fainting
           and sickness did affect me still).<anchor xml:id="ev161-end" type="event"/> But I received comfortable letters from

            friends (videlicet, <persName ref="ppl:tp1">Mr Portington</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:xr1">Mr Raines</persName>) to whom <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>
            had made a mortgage of 99 years over <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> (as I mentioned,

           Yet,  this <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was thus stated then and under these burdens,
          which was more than the land was worth or ever could pay.
           Where then was any provision left for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my two daughters</rs> if

           Yet, upon <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> decease, it was thought fit to
           secure this rentcharge of my portion and <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton's</persName> debt, which
           come to £2000, out of <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford's</persName> estate.
          This rentcharge also must be made over by deeds to them
           (<persName ref="ppl:tp1">Mr Portington</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:xr1">Mr Raines</persName>) for the better security of their two
           mortgages, besides all <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> was made to them.
      </p>
         <p>
           And by which money, of <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName> for the rentcharge
           out of <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName>, was the mortgages paid in process of time,
          which could never

               
             have been done out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> but by the sale
           of it. And so have extirpated that estate from the family, and none

             father's</rs> estate if not redeemed thus by my right.</p>
         <p>
           But my brother, <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>, knowing this £1000 
            in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> was my portion and that it was made over to me
          by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> before marriage, would not pay any part of that rentcharge to the <persName ref="ppl:an1">administrator</persName> of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> but only to myself, being my due and right to have enjoyed now in my widowed
          estate according to articles and bond before marriage.
      </p>
         <p>
           I was forced to inform him that for that end — that <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
                Thornton</persName> should settle <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> by <persName ref="ppl:rc2">Covill's</persName> deed upon <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my daughters</rs>
          for provision for portions and maintenance his debts being so
           great — that to pay them and free his land, I was willing to yield
           up that £1000  to clear his estate and make provision for <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">his two children</rs>.
          And so I was to have no part in it, but desired it might
          be paid by him as the £1000  he paid to <persName ref="ppl:rn1">Nettleton</persName> was to go to the
        satisfaction of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts.
      <anchor xml:id="ev164-end" type="event"/></p>
          
         <p>
           (When, in the meantime, still this heavy mortgage laid upon
           the estate of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName> and nothing, in reality, formally settled upon any
          of my children, nor anything in the world to maintain <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my
            dear and only son</rs> — then but six years old — and all swallowed up
          with debts from us. Nor had I ever one penny of all <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs>
          portion to do me good in all my life nor my children:
           these was pinching circumstances for me to begin my life with.) 
      </p>
         <p>
           Yet, although I was thus willing to rob myself of my right
           and comfortable subsistence for myself and <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">poor son</rs>, who I had
           undertaken to maintain and educate without any assistance,
          but to enter into debt the first hour of my widowhood.


        <pb xml:id="page-165"/>






         And had then a certain and great debt due to my own

           <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs>. In the first place, there was a great sum
          of money due from thence for my own maintenance and
          education since <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> death after £80<am>l</am>  per annum
           for 12 years. Also, the sum of £6000   fell due to me
           by the death of <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my dear brother, George Wandesford</persName>, who
          was heir.</p>
         <p>
           The estate fell upon <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>, as next heir, and

           and he, dying without issue, the same £6000  fell due to me as his

          <p>
    <milestone xml:id="ev165-start" unit="event"/>
         
           But the greatest and most easy to have been obtained —
          and which I had the greatest injury done by
           not obtaining it — was that
           of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> jointure and annuity of £300<am>l</am>  per annum
           in <placeName ref="place:Irel_096">Ireland</placeName> (charged overall both by deed of annuity of it to be
            first paid out of that land of <placeName ref="place:Cast_085">Idough</placeName>, and also charged by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my

         </p>
         <p>
           Due for 19 years after his death, of which she never received
           one penny, though <persName ref="ppl:jl1">Sir John Lowther</persName> offered her (in my hearing) £1500 
           if she would resign her right to <persName ref="ppl:cw2">his son, Christopher</persName>, in it. But she,
          hoping <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> would reap the benefit according to her true intent
          to do justly to pay the debt of <persName ref="ppl:eo1">Sir Edward Osborne</persName> for <persName ref="ppl:gw1">my brother George</persName>

       
           his wardship, she made a deed to feoffees in trust for that purpose
           to pay that debt out of it. And all the rest of her arrears that she

had settled for my use and my children to receive and lay
           out the remainder of those arrears (being £7000)  to purchase land
          of inheritance for me and my poor children.<anchor xml:id="ev165-end" type="event"/></p>
          
         <p>
           Yet, nothing of this would be taken into consideration, either
           by one or the other; either to demand the said dues for myself and children,
          or the other to give me in lieu of it.</p>
         <p>
              Albeit I stood upon it to have it demanded as my right and
           due, yet they was so cold in the matter that there was nothing
           done in it, in my behalf (lest of offending <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher</persName>, who was then to pay
           that annuity I should have had for debts).
      </p>
         <p>
           Although that was designed, so yet it would have been no
          disadvantage to debts of my children's welfare to have been
           better enabled to have performed all, if my rights had been gained
           to the satisfaction of my dear uncle <persName ref="ppl:eo1">Sir Edward Osborne's</persName> debt, which
        
           <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> gave first out of those arrears, which by remissness
           and neglect was quite lost. Nay, the gaining of the one would have


        <pb xml:id="page-166"/>






            
         

              been the way and means to have got the other arrears due to
           me, and the neglect of the first was the loss of the whole arrears
          to the destruction of myself and estate.</p>

    <milestone xml:id="ev166-start" unit="event"/>
         
           But, instead of my receiving any advantage from them,
        when <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher</persName> saw that my £1000 was thus condemned
          to the debts of <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> — and that his estate could not
           subsist without that annuity out of his estate due to me (as above) —
          he was very earnest to have me to make him a general
          release of all my rights and dues to me out of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs>
            estate, either by myself or <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> or <persName ref="ppl:jw1">my brother, John Wandesford</persName>,
          which he very well knew was a very great sum of money.
      </p>
         <p>
              And before he would yield to pay one penny of the annuity
          to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> <rs ref="ppl:an1" type="person">administrator</rs>, he stood upon this point and
           would do nothing or pay any dues; so, having made his
           demand of these things (which I suppose was by the advice of <rs ref="ppl:jl1" type="person">his

           <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my mother's</rs> out of that estate, but kept this as a rod over us
          to make me yield to these unjust demands knowing how
           low <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> estate was judged) we could not obtain it
          by course of law or have any right from him.</p>
         <p>
              This sad oppression was very grievous over my weak
           spirits, who had none in the world to take my part or to assist
          me to get my dues; nor was it judged fit to advise with my
          dear uncle <persName ref="ppl:eo1">Sir Edward Osborne's</persName> relations about this concern
           — which so much concerned them — lest the acting in that might be to
        
        hinder the payment of the annuity for <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts.
      </p>
         <p>
           But, alas, I was left into a deep distress and great
          dilemma what to do or which way to take for deliverance out of
          this labyrinth. I had none to fly unto for redress but to
           the God of mercies, who is a fountain of infinite mercy
           to all those which rely upon his providence and defence. To him, alone,

           and relief to bring me out these straits,
          and for deliverance out of all my distress.</p>
         <p>
              For the sad apprehension of those evils fallen on me and

           <persName ref="ppl:xb3">Mr Binlowes</persName> (a turncoat, bitter presbyterian, <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher</persName> made use
           of)
           which cut me totally off, or any of mine, from ever having any
          benefit of <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs> will by which I had very great dues.
           Yet, I would not do it or sign any at all until I had some
          advice about it.</p>
         <p>
              For I was greatly concerned to consider what a poor and
           low condition this estate was in by debts, which was too much
          contracted by <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford's</persName> obstinacy against <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> for that
        
        unfortunate taking the assignment of the Irish estate on him.</p>
         <p>
              Yet was I more willing to suffer loss in my own private
           estate, if possible I might wade through it, provided that I
           might be advised how to secure — out of my love to <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear
             son</rs> and the family — those rights and dues I had from <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father's</rs>
           estate, if I could have it secured to <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my poor son</rs> and family.</p>
          
          <p>
    
         
           To this end, I advised with <persName ref="ppl:xh4">Mr Hassell</persName>, an able lawyer, about
          this business who did draw up a deed of gift for me to seal
           and sign, in a legal manner, to feoffees in trust


        <pb xml:id="page-168"/>






            
           

         of all my rights, dues and titles to what <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my honoured father</rs> and
           <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> had given me by and in their last wills and testaments;
            references being thereunto had (as may at large) appear in
           all their deeds, and gifts and bequeaths belonging to myself, or
           <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> or <rs ref="ppl:cw2" type="person">brother</rs>.</p>
          <p>
           And to settle them all (upon the feoffees
           in trust) for the use and behoof of <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my only son</rs> and heir, to
           him and his issue and, for default of such issue, then to the use
           and behoof of my two daughters, <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Alice</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:ktp1">Katherine
             Thornton</persName>, to them and their heirs forever, </p>
         <p>
               to be laid out in land of inheritance, purchased for them
          as near as could be obtained to be near unto <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>
           estate of <placeName ref="place:East_019">East Newton</placeName> and <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>. And yet, nevertheless,
          reserving power in myself: a power of revocation.
           The trustees nominated: <persName ref="ppl:rg1">Ranald Graham</persName>, esquire,
           <persName ref="ppl:xw1">Dr Watkinson</persName>, master chancellor of <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName>, and <persName ref="ppl:xb9">Dr Burton</persName>.
      </p>
         <p>
              This deed of trust, or gift of mine was dated,
             in the
            
            
        before the release was signed by me to <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName>
           which was drawn up by my counsel's advice, <persName ref="ppl:xd4">Mr Driffield</persName>.
          Nor would I do it to rob myself
        of every bequeath which <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my
          dear father</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">mother</rs> had out of their tender affection
          given to me, but would have that only reserved to myself
           of £100, given by <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my dear father</rs> in his
           will to <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother</rs> to buy her a jewel.</p>
         <p>
           Which <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher</persName>, or some for him, thought much at that I
           should not be a cast out or exposed from that family in all but,
           with much to do, I did afterwards receive the same £100<am>l</am>.
         </p>
         <p>

           
           £50<am>l</am> of which I received and paid my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> that
          £50<am>l</am>  I borrowed of her, and the other £50<am>l</am>  was paid by me for
           the discharge of some debt of <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my son Thornton</persName> at <placeName ref="place:Camb_007">Cambridge</placeName>.
          But I humbly bless Almighty God for this great mercy that
          I received in this £100<am>l</am>  which relieved myself and <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">poor son</rs>. </p>
         <p>
              The release of mine to <persName ref="ppl:cw2">Sir Christopher Wandesford</persName> was dated –

              Thus was I stripped of all the great riches and honourable enjoyments
          I had right unto which I yielded to do for the good and quiet of
           this family being unable in body — or purse — to resist this great
           pressure was laid for me, which proved the overthrow of this poor estate.


        <pb xml:id="page-169"/>






           Which, if it might have been rightly managed in <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs>
           lifetime, or since his death, by some friend or assistance to have
           succoured me in my distress, it would have been so great an
          advantage to have purchased a double estate to what I found
           and made a most flourishing family as was in this <placeName ref="place:Ryed_129">country</placeName>.
      </p>
         <p>
           But, since I am now reduced to this degree of loss in those
          riches which God had given me, I humbly beg his grace and
          patience to be supported under the hand of God, which he did
          see fit to bring me to under great burdens and debts and losses which I no
           ways was contributory to: either by my pride, extravagancy,
          voluptuousness; excess or wastefulness of what the Lord had
           given me; nor by any way of imprudence to that managery
           of what was under my care, or part to perform in my power.</p>
         <p>
              I hope that God and my own conscience will not condemn
           me for any of these things since what I did do (in point
          of housekeeping, diet, apparel or entertainments) was
           ever designed and practised to keep within bounds of moderation,
          decency and necessity. Nor ever I affected to conform myself to the modes or quirks of new fashions and affected novelties, either in meat, drink, apparel of the gaieties of the world,
           not even in the prime of my youth when, as Job sayeth, the<quote xml:id="q-410" type="partial" source="#KJV_Job_29:3">
        candle of the Lord shined upon me</quote>.</p>
         <p>
              But I bless God for his grace to me in giving me to
           strive and endeavour after the adorning of my spirit and 
        [heart]
    ,
            with all those <quote xml:id="q-411" type="allusion" source="#_Colossians_3:12 #_1Timothy_6:11">Christian virtues of faith, humility, patience

          Jesus Christ and him crucified</quote>; that by following of him in his

           in true and faithful, conjugal love to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and his family.</p>
         <p>
           I cannot deny <milestone xml:id="ev169-start" unit="event"/>but when <rs ref="ppl:kwd1" type="person">my dear and only sister's</rs> family,
           some of them, fell into decay and the estate taken away by the late
          rebellion against <persName ref="ppl:cs1">King Charles I</persName> and so exposed to much
           poverty, especially <rs ref="ppl:cd4" type="person">the second son</rs> who married against <rs ref="ppl:td3" type="person">his father's</rs> command,
           and came to be a family miserable enough. To relieve himself and family,
           I did expend out of <rs ref="ppl:aow1" type="person">my dear mother's</rs> estate, she gave me some
          considerable sums to relieve that family but not without <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> knowledge or consent, who never was backward in those
          points of charity.<anchor xml:id="ev169-end" type="event"/>
      </p>
         <p>
           And if, in this point I have erred, I humbly beg pardon since
          affection, necessity and charity obliged my assistance in their cases.</p>


        <pb xml:id="page-170"/>





         <p>
         And if now, I am reduced to want those necessaries I bestowed
           on them, and their estates be now flourishing, and mine 
          brought down to want and indigency by great and many debts
           contracted by others, and for the saving the estate I am now
          so low, I will not yet despair in the mighty help and
          relief of a mighty and merciful Father of heaven, </p>
         <p>
            who both sees my distress and, I hope, will pity my condition.
            And though he has raised three families by my means and my
          friends to great riches and glory in the world and given me
          to <quote xml:id="q-413" type="allusion" source="#_Matthew_26:39 #_Mark_14:36 #_Luke_22:42">taste of his bitter cup of sufferings</quote> for others.</p>

           both can and, I hope, will raise me out of this poor estate
          and give me sufficient sustentation, support, relief and
           deliverance out of this land of bondage.
      </p>
         <p>
              Even as his mercy did to that poor widow of

           known all the intrigues of this family, so he would do

           Which <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> was pleased to do. And so,

          it did very much satisfy all who she saw cause to declare

         <p>
            He, being so wise and prudent a person, was more

            in this deep distress of sorrows, I did much
          continue for several months together. But the greatest
           comfort I took was in the consideration of God's almighty
           power to bring me out of all, and was my support under it (in
          the testimony of a clear conscience) and while I was able to do
           my duty (what my poor ability was) in teaching <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear

           as I was sitting on the longsettle in my chamber, and hearing read in 
          the gospel of St Matthew, my heart was full of sorrow and bitterness of spirit, being overwhelmed with all sorts of afflictions
           that lay upon me; considering my poor condition either to
           pay debts to maintain <persName ref="ppl:rt2">this poor, young child</persName> or to give
           him that education which I would and designed by God's blessing to
          bring him up a clergy man and a true minister of the gospel
           (<quote xml:id="q-419" type="allusion" source="#_1Samuel_1:10-28">according to my vow and promise made to God, when I begged
          him of God in obedience to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband's</rs> longing desire
           to have a son to heir this ancient house and family</quote>).</p>
         <p>
              And now God granted that request in giving me a
          son and one blessed with great hopes of promising parts
          and apt to learn all good things taught him, yet such
          was my low and mean estate reduced to that I wanted
           a sufficient supply out of my own jointure (being but
           very little made of it by those tenants) either to
           maintain him or myself, and great debts, public charity
           and unavoidable payments out of it. </p>
         <p>
              All which considerations came on my thoughts together did overflow my weak spirits at that time. And how
           I should ever be able to subsist or ever bring him up,
           according to my promise and vow made to my God,
          in which I was almost drove to despair in myself that
           God, who was so gracious to all and had been so to me,
      </p>
         <p>
              yet such was his great displeasure against me that
          he seemed to afflict me more than any, with all his heavy
           arrows at once: both in body, spirit and estate by the
          loss of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>, my <quote xml:id="q-420" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote>, my goods and
           all other heavy pressures upon me, and taken away most
           of my friends that might have supported me.</p>
         <p>
              All which did so oppress my heart and did persuade
          me that <quote xml:id="q-421" type="allusion" source="#_2Kings_17:20">God had forsaken me and cast
             me out of his sight</quote>
          and that I could no way find any comfort, since <quote xml:id="q-422" type="allusion" source="#KJV_Psalms_77:7">I feared
           the Lord had cast me off forever</quote>.</p>
         <p>
              The deep reflection which wounded most was that I had
           deserved justly at God's hand to be cast off <quote xml:id="q-423" type="allusion" source="#_2Corinthians_6:14">because I had
             matched into a contrary faith and opinion to my own</quote>
           and, therefore, I was thus sadly followed by sufferings. And
           also, if I should be taken from <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs>, knew not into
           what hand they might light into, though God knew
             what I had


        <pb xml:id="page-173"/>






         suffered and endeavoured to secure my faith to God and <rs type="group">the
           children</rs> he gave me (and that this was a great motive to
           me to match <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs>, so as to establish his faith in my
           family and in the right principling them in religion).
      </p>
         <p>
              But such was my sad affliction at this time that
           passion and a flood of tears overcame my reason and religion,
          and made me to leave <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear child</rs> when I was teaching him to read. And could not contain my great and infinite sorrows, but scarce got to my bedside for falling down,
           when I then cast myself cross the beds, fell in bitter weeping
          and extreme passion for offending God or provoking his wrath
          against me to leave and forsake me thus forlorn.</p>
         <p>
           But, while I was in this desperate condition and full
          of despair in myself, behold the miraculous goodness of
          God, even that God who I apprehended had forsaken me and
          cast me off forever, in that very instant of time did

           <persName ref="ppl:rt2">My dear son, Robert</persName>, seeing me fallen down on the
        bed in such a sad condition and bitter weeping, comes to me to the
           bedside, and being deeply concerned to see me in such extremity,
           crept on the bed with his poor hands and knees, and cast himself on
           my breast. And embracing me in his arms and laid his cheek
           to mine, with abundance of tears,</p>
         <p>
            cried out to me in these words: 'Oh, <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my dear, sweet
          mother</rs>! What is the reason that you do weep and lament
          and mourn so much and ready to break your heart? Is it
          for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my father</rs> that you do mourn for so much?'</p>
         <p>
           To which I answered: 'Ah, <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear child</rs>, it is for the loss
           of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">thy dear father</rs>. Have I not cause? For I am this day <quote xml:id="q-424" type="allusion" source="#KJV_Timothy_5:5">a

           without help or any relief'. To which <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my dear infant</rs> answered:</p>
         <p>
            'Do you not, <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my dear mother</rs>, believe that <rs ref="ppl:cw1" type="person">my father</rs>
          is gone to heaven?'</p>
         <p>
           To which I replied again: 'Yes, I do believe and hope through
           Christ's merits and sufferings for us that <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">thy dear father</rs> is gone
           to heaven'.</p>
         <p>
           Upon which, he said to me again: 'And would you
          have <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my father</rs> to come out of heaven, where he enjoys
           God and all joy and happiness, to come down out of heaven and
          endure all those sicknesses and sorrows (he did to comfort you) here?</p>

          dear mother</rs>, do not weep and lament thus very
           sore; for if I live, I will take care for you and comfort
           you, but if you weep thus and mourn, </p>
         <p>
               you will break my heart and then all is gone.
           Therefore, <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">my dear mother</rs>, be comforted in God and he will
           preserve you'. All which words — uttered with so great a compassion,
          affection and filial dearness and tenderness — can never be forgot
          by me, but this excellent counsel came from God and not
           from man: for none but the spirit of God could put such words

         <p>
           Therefore, I acknowledge the glory to my gracious God

           It is better to serve this holy, pure God and righteous spirit

           The first time he went to church at <placeName ref="place:Ston_054">Stonegrave</placeName>, he was

           not remember to tell me the text and sermon, he should go no more,
          not to be idle and look about him but to hear and remember what

       About <date when-custom="1669-03-25">March 25, 1669</date>, I was writing of my 'First Book of My Life'
         to enter the sad sicknesses and death of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs> together
       with all those afflictions befell me that year, with the remarks of 
         God's dealing with myself, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">husband</rs> and <rs ref="ppl:xt1 ppl:atc1 ppl:et1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:xt2 ppl:wt2 ppl:jt1 ppl:ct1" type="group">children</rs> until my widowed
         condition, as I had done ever since I could remember from my
          first youth and childhood. There happened me then a very strange
         and dangerous accident to me, casually, which might have been of
          a dangerous consequence to the sight of my left eye, if not to have
          influenced upon both and have put them out. 
      </p>
         <p>
            which shows we are ever in danger and never free from the worst of
          casualties without the watchful eye of divine providence to guard
          both our souls and bodies from the hostility of the devil; even when we
           may think ourselves most safe and free from harm, in an innocent
           or religious employment, then doth our enemy watch to do us evil.
      </p>
         <p>
           The occasion was thus, which had like to have been so fatal
           to me. There was a poor little creature, harmless in itself, and without
          any gall or malice to do hurt.
      </p>

        <pb xml:id="page-179"/>






          <p>A little young chicken (not above 14 days old) which had been exposed
            and picked out of hen's nest that hatched it, and by her was turned out 
            from amongst the flock she had newly hatched (being about nine in
            number, all which she brooked and made much of, but this poor chick
            she had turned out of the nest). In a morning, when the maid came to
            see if she was hatched, and finding this poor chicken cast out
          of the nest on the ground and for dead and cold. But the maid took
          it up and put it under the hen to have recruited it by warmth.</p>
         <p>
              But the hen was so wild and mad at it that she would not
           let it be with her or come near her, but picked it, and bit it and
           scratched it out with her feet twice or thrice when the maid put it in;
           so that she see no hopes of the hen to nurse it up as the rest, so
          she took it up and put it in her breast to recover it.
      </p>
         <p>
           And so, she brought this poor creature to me and told me all
          this story with great indignation against the unnaturalness of
           its mother. But I, pitying
               
           this forlorn creature in that case, could
           not withhold my care to see if I could any way save the life of it,
          and carried it to the fire, lapped
             it in wool, and got some cordial
           waters and opened its bill, and put a drop by little and little, and then it gasped
           and came to life within an hour (giving it warm milk until it was recovered)
           and became a fine pert chicken.
      </p>
         <p>
           Thus, I saved it and recovered it again, making much of it and was
           very fond of it, having recovered it to life, and kept it in a basket with 
          wool in the nights and in my pocket in the days until it came to be
          a very pretty coloured and a strong bird, about 14 or 16 days old.
           And sometimes put it in to my bosom to nourish and bring it up (hoping
          it had been a hen chick and then I fancied it might have brought
           me eggs in time and so got a breed of it). This was my innocent
          diversion in my melancholy hours.</p>
         <p>
           Until one day, about <date when-custom="1669-02-02">Candlemas, 1669</date>,
               
               having begun a
          Book, wherein I had entered very many and great remarks
          of my course of life what God had done for me since my
          childhood, in my youth and younger years until continued
           to my married estate. And for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>, relations
           and <rs ref="ppl:xt1 ppl:atc1 ppl:et1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:xt2 ppl:wt2 ppl:jt1 ppl:ct1" type="group">children</rs> having writ down most remarks of my
          life, which observations of mercies, deliverances and thanksgivings
           thereupon, until I came to the later part, which concerned my
           loss of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>. And was, at that time, entering
          my fatal loss and the passages of his sickness with other occurrences
          befell me before and after his death.
      </p>
         <p>
           And as I was writing in my said Book, I took out this
          poor chicken out of my pocket to feed it with bread and set it on


        <pb xml:id="page-180"/>






            
           

           the table besides me. It, picking about the bread innocently, did
          peep up at my left eye. Whether it thought the white of my
           eye had been some bread — while I was attent on my Book in
           writing, held my head and eye down, not suspecting any
           hurt or fearing any evil accident — this poor, little bird
          picked one pick at the white of my left eye as I looked
           downward, which did so extremely smart and ache that
          I could not look up or see of either of my eyes.</p>
         <p>
              And the pain and bloodshot of it grew up into a little
           knot and lump, with the hurt and bruise in that tender part, that
        
        I was sore swelled and bloodshot that it took away the sight
           of it for a long time and had a skin and pearl of it.
           And which pain and sickness brought me to my bed, and I could not
           see almost anything of it and endangered the sight of both.</p>
         <p>
           This was a great misfortune which happened then, and like
           to have proved fatal if I had lost my precious sight by it
           and, notwithstanding all the means I could use, was very
          extreme on me by pains and anguish it brought on me; nor
          could I eat, or sleep or be at ease for 14 days until it did
          please God to mitigate my sorrows and gave me ease by what
           I used to it.
      </p>
          <p>
           Thus, had I cause to call upon my gracious God and
           Father of heaven, who had permitted so great an evil to
           come upon me to wound that part, which I had so great a
           cause to make use of by tears and sorrow in this my troubled
           and sad condition. But since I suffered by a poor creature,
           who had no gall or malice to me but in its being mistaken,
          I could have no resent against that creature but endeavoured to
           take my pains with patience; since I had deserved from God to
           have lost my sight from him that gave it, and was at this time
          dealt with abundance of mercy in all the passages of his providence
          who had given me speedy help. 

               

         </p>
         <p>
            He did, in great mercy, preserve my right eye and at 
           length restored my sight, about six weeks or more that I had
          suffered by it, nor could I suffer this poor creature to be killed
           (as I was put upon for this) for it did in its innocency.</p>
         <p>
              There was some who jested with me and said they had heard of
          an old saying of bringing up a chicken to peck out their eye.
             But
           now they saw I had made good that old saying, both in this bird


        <pb xml:id="page-181"/>






           and what harm I had suffered from <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName>, of whom I
           had been so careful and preserved her and hers from starving.
      </p>
         <p>
           But I told them that her crime was more unpardonable;
          for what was done by her was out of malice and unmerited from 
          me, and what I did for hers and her was out of my Christian
        
           charity and God's cause, and only of pity I saved the dying
          chicken.

          <p>
           But I humbly bless God for all my deliverances,
          both from the death of my good name and my body and my
           soul, which was aimed at by my spiritual and worldly
          enemies, and also praise his holy name for the deliverance
           of my bodily eyes (so precious and useful a mercy) which
        was the great comfort of my soul and body by which I may
           see to read my duty in the word of God, to pray and to

                children</rs> and do my duty in that estate of life unto the which
        it pleased God to call me.</p>
         <p>
           Oh, what shall I render to the most high <quote xml:id="q-467" type="phrase" source="#_Ezra_5:11">God of heaven
             and earth</quote>, who has looked upon my affliction in this thing

          I may find out the way to the true light which thou givest
           to all those that truly love and fear thee.
      </p>
         <p>

          until I arrive at the land of everlasting rest. And this I humbly beg for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ  and that for his merits,

         <p> 
           Thus, have I new occasion upon every action of my life
          to bless and praise the Lord my God, who hath so watchful
          an eye over me; for if this chicken had light with its bill on the
        
        sight, or black of my eye, it had infallibly put it out and
           much endangered the other eye too (there being so great a sympathy
           betwixt them in the optics). Therefore, will I praise and glorify the
           God of mercy for both and humbly beseech him that with these very eyes,
           as Job saith, <quote xml:id="q-472" type="paraphrase" source="#KJV_Job_19:26-27">I may see God: not another for me</quote>, but with these eyes

           do I hope and long for to see God, my Creator and Father of Heaven
           and Jesus Christ, the redeemer, and my saviour and deliverer;
           and the Holy Spirit, the sanctifier of all the elect people

              It was not long after this visitation that I had
          the great trial of grief on me about the release I was

         <p>
              All this time I had great payments demanded for
           debts and for the funerals, and maintenance of <rs ref="ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my two children</rs>,
          my family having received but small sums both

             and all interest. And when that
            
           failed, I was forced to make up payments for it and other
           things out of my own purse or out of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, which was
           designed out for the children's (<rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">two daughters</rs>) maintenance.</p>

         <p>
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">My eldest daughter</rs> being married, her maintenance

          but came so short everylike

           At which time, <persName ref="ppl:en2">my cousin Elizabeth Nicholson</persName>, which was niece
           to them all, being at <placeName ref="place:Ripo_074">Ripon</placeName> and made acquainted by them
           what most vile aspersions <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> had invented, and others,
           against <persName ref="ppl:tc1">my son Comber</persName>, so that I was made a reproach by some —
           but not my friends — for marrying <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> to him (being
          a clergyman) and which had come to my <persName ref="ppl:xf5">Lady Frankland's</persName> ears
          and my <persName ref="ppl:xw5">Lady Wyvill</persName> and others.
      </p>
         <p>
           But <persName ref="ppl:en2">my dear cousin Nicholson</persName>, seeing that I had
          this mischief done and traduced
               
           in my best of my actions, had
          a great deal of concern for my wronged virtue and was
           desired by <rs type="group">her aunts</rs> (as before) to acquaint me with those abuses
           my enemies put upon me. And desired that I would let them
           see my papers and letters which did concern that business,
          and the reasons and occasion which caused <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and myself to match <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">our daughter</rs> there.
      </p>
         <p>
              Together with all those letters of court from <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">my son</rs> to
           her, with <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> letter of advice to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> rather to
           choose her than <persName ref="ppl:xh5">Mr Holland's</persName> <rs ref="ppl:xh6" type="person">daughter</rs>, which at that time he
           had proposed at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName> with a living of £100<am>l</am>  a year for him.</p>
         <p>
           And several letters to me — of <rs ref="ppl:xc4" type="person">his mother</rs> and himself — to
           desire my consent for <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">her son</rs> to match with <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>,
          with many other material circumstances convincing all
          that see them of the just grounds and candid
           
             reasons for us
          to consent to this motion.</p>
         <p>
              All which papers are very material to the purpose and true
           evidences of all our integrity and virtue, and convincing proofs
           of <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> vileness and abominable treachery and falsehood
          to abuse such

               
           honest proceedings, after she had so solemnly
           protested to the contrary (to <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton</persName>) she
          would never speak of such things after she was gone from
           <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> (which, if she had not done to clear herself, <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear husband</rs>
           did protest he would have punished her and <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">her servant</rs>).

              These letters, papers and transaction of this affair are

         <p>
           and for the good end, now spoken to satisfy all my friends
           or all good people, <persName ref="ppl:en2">my cousin, Elizabeth Nicholson</persName>, desired me to send
           her those letters and papers aforesaid, which I did send to her to
           <placeName ref="place:Ripo_074">Ripon</placeName>. And from thence she sent them, by my order and <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne's</persName>
          desire to her, to show my friends at <placeName ref="place:Rich_043">Richmond</placeName> and to my
          <persName ref="ppl:xw5">Lady Wyvill</persName>
               
             who was much concerned for all my wrongs and
          pitied me extremely much.<anchor xml:id="ev180-end" type="event"/></p>

          <p>
    
         
           The letter of account, which I received from <persName ref="ppl:en2">my cousin Nicholson</persName>
           in answer to mine, was as follows. Dated: <date when-custom="1669-12-02">December 2nd, 1669</date>.</p>
          
         
             <p>
              <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">Most worthy cousin</rs>, I received your last and have performed
               your desire and sent your letters to <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> by <persName ref="ppl:tg1">my cousin, Thomas Gill,</persName>
               who I met with at <placeName ref="place:Ripo_074">Ripon</placeName>, where I have done you all the right
          I possibly could in making you appear by your prudence from
          time to time truly virtuous, and not so imprudent an act
          as it appeared to some in the matching of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">your daughter</rs>.
      </p>
          <p>
           And, in relating the truth, makes <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> appear
           what she is: not a saint, but an unworthy woman. So let me,
           <rs ref="ppl:awt1" type="person">dear cousin</rs>, beg that you will satisfy yourself and not
           impair your health by your immoderate sorrow and grieving,
          nor offend him who is able to make the very stones bear
           witness for your innocency which, I pray believe me, is
           believed by all worthy and noble and worthy persons.
           As for my worthy <persName ref="ppl:xf5">Lady Frankland</persName>, she doth both love and
           honour you as a woman of excellent parts, and pities
          you as one that hath been so much wronged by all your
           servants. I desire you not to write until I consider and see you.
          And I must needs tell you that <rs ref="ppl:xf5" type="person">my Lady</rs> told <rs type="person">my husband</rs>
           — that of all the sermons that ever she heard in all her life —
          that sermon that your <persName ref="ppl:tc1">son Comber</persName> preached before my
           <persName ref="ppl:xf6">Lord Falconbridge</persName> was the very best. And for her part, she
          can never have an evil thought of him while she breathes
          but doth believe he hath been much wronged.
      </p>
         <p>
            You may see what God can and will do for you and yours;
           for which mercy, let you and me praise his holy name, and
           give him thanks forever and cheerfully suffer what
          he pleaseth to lay on us.</p>
         
          
          
         <p>
              Thus far I thought good to enter here that some
           of my friends and children see that God had in a manner, as she
           said,  raised the stones to vindicate and speak for me against hell itself, and to confute all my wicked adversaries
           when my very friends and servants was stirred up against us;
           because I had a desire to have the gospel planted in my family,
           I was made a scorn
              
             of those that hated it and me for it. And God
          opened the mouths of these very friends to stand for my innocency

             and to right my cause where I could not do it myself</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-186"/>






            

          <p>in regard that this match was of so great a concernment
          to myself and family, because my enemies had stirred up all
          my friends against me, and had raised up such numbers of 
           lies and slanders against me for it that it might have been prevented;
          and to make my life more miserable by the breaking it so ill
          and from the cause of those odious slanders cast on my innocent
           actions; and for the settlement of my family and <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">children</rs> in
          some comfortable condition in the world, </p>
         <p>
               I am obliged in duty to God first, and the clear 
          satisfaction of my own conscience, the world and my own
           family (whose good I have ever established before my own)
          to leave behind me the full evidences of truth concerning
          this business: when it began, and how proceeded, and upon what
        occasion the affair was first thought upon, with a good
          and mature deliberation.</p>
         <p>
           As letters of mine will manifest, both to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>
           and to very many of my dear friends and relations, who had
           been endeavoured to have turned my enemies by <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> until
           by God's providence the matter was tried out and my cause
           heard. And those which was my friends could not but pity my
           sad calamity which fell under the scourge of the tongue.
      </p>
         <p>
              I had no better evidence to satisfy my friends and all
          virtuous persons which had been abused by her malice to me
          but to make a collection of letters, papers, verses and my
           answer to my adversaries — who had reined in my house and
           had bitter malice against me for reproving their sins, to
          be revenged of me then to raise up the devil of lies and
           odious calumnies, which I am sure in their own conscience I
          was so clear that I hated them with a perfect hatred and would
           have died before I had been guilty — so that these evidences
           will, I hope, be kept by <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my children</rs> for a justification of my
          innocency and a condemnation of all their wickedness
          who had any hand by the murder committed on my <quote xml:id="q-476" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good
          name</quote> and innocency. And will rise up in judgement against
          all those liars and forgeries which has not repented and asked
           pardon of God and us, who they wronged.

          deed of entail being cut off, of <placeName ref="place:Lays_032">Leysthorpe</placeName>, and that I had

             from <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my children</rs>, as I have made mention of in this Book.
             Upon which, the grief had like to have killed me and did bring me
             to a miscarriage because, if I had died, then my children
             had been left without any certain provision at all,<anchor xml:id="ev188-end" type="event"/> which
        
        I took so to heart as that I could not but write my
             thoughts to <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs>. And in my letter gave him such
          pressing and true reasons for his consenting to the motion
             of marriage for <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> (both on the
        
             reason of his own often sickness of the palsy and his relapse,
          together with my now great weakness on me that I could
             hope that either of us should continue long). And that <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this
               gentleman</rs> was so hopeful and promising; might be a great
          stay and support to take care both of <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my son</rs> in his education
             and of the other <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">two daughters</rs> after our decease. 
               

             </p>

           children</rs> in the hand of one that we knew would be
           careful to bring them up in the true faith and fear of God, and
           would take care of their temporal estate, which he knew in
           what a condition it was in at present. So, I humbly
          left the consideration of this weighty affair to his consideration and begged of God to direct us both to do for the
           best, for his glory and our comfort in <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">our children's</rs> happiness.</p>

          for the false lies and calumniations against us.
      </p>
         <p>
           Such was the fury of <persName ref="ppl:bt1">Barbary's</persName> malice against us that,

           life of <rs ref="ppl:cw1 ppl:aow1" type="group">my parents</rs> — it more wounded me than my own. For
           they was long since died, honourable deaths and lived holy, exemplary

           of the scarlet chamber and broke it open. And hearing my complaint,
           and seeing my condition, did kick <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">that wench</rs> downstairs

           too, but that I begged he would not because she had no house
          nor harbour to go to and I trusted God would revenge my cause.

           And she cried out to God for pardon and forgiveness of God,

           and in him, I trust, will do it to the end of my days, against
           hell and all his malice to accuse me: in whom, I hope, he nor

              Though I was extremely weak by this saddest trial of my unspotted honour, yet still I was supported under it that I did not

          I was cast down into my bed of sickness and weakness upon

           from those horrid blasphemies against myself and <rs ref="ppl:cw1 ppl:aow1" type="group">holy parents</rs>,
          but I could not endure such things to be said of the dead who
           was laid in the bed of honour and their names recorded in
           heaven. Therefore, did desire she would prepare to go whither
          she might act her own affairs since she had made me not
          capable to serve her any longer, and sent her the £3<am>l</am>  which made
           up the last £5<am>l</am>  to be £8 to provide for herself. I, being
           in so weak a condition, expected nothing but death, but did
          hope that as God knew my wrongs and innocency so he would
           judge me righteously. (<date when-custom="1668-08-12">August 12th, 1668</date>.)</p>

           After this, my <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> did

              that she might be able to satisfy all my friends of my

           <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my poor children</rs>, and what condition I was reduced

               

             into after the
            
           entail was cut off, and many other great remarks of my life
          which I know would take away all those scruples and false
          calumnies against my proceedings in that match.</p>
         <p>
           <rs ref="ppl:dcl1" type="person">This poor woman</rs> did show the said Book to my <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt

        sent to her to let her know how much I was wronged and to
           speak to her about me — with great grief and many tears did
           express her concerns and pitied my case, saying that I had
          ever been a most virtuous woman all my life and now to
           be so abused did wound her very 
        [heart]
    . And so got my Book
           of her to read, which she did with a great delight (as she said) and yet with
        much grief to see me so greatly wronged by those I had done
           so much for. And did heartily beg of God that he would
           <quote xml:id="q-487" type="phrase" source="#_Lamentations_3:59">judge my cause</quote> and revenge my wronged innocency upon all
           that had a hand in it, and prayed heartily for me and mine.
           <anchor xml:id="ev203-end" type="event"/>

            write a most excellent, pious and comfortable letter to me

           and for his own glory and my comfort. Thus, with many Christian
           arguments did <rs ref="ppl:xw5" type="person">this holy, good Lady</rs> strive to comfort me.</p>

         <p>
           And, indeed, I had great cause to bless and praise the
           God of heaven, which gave me such comfortable letters of <rs ref="ppl:xw5" type="person">this good
             and dear Lady</rs> and the rest; for which I praise my God for this mercy
           and all of this kind, beseeching him to bless her and all hers with his

          heaven and all the rest of my dear friends in my distress.

         <p>
           I did also receive at this time my said Book home,

           which did abundantly please and satisfy her and said that it was
          not writ as if a weak woman might have done it but might
           have become a divine. Though she knew the contents to be of my
           whole life to that time, but she gave me her advice that the sense
           of the world was in general of the match of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>,</p>

         <p>
          and that she was put on it to come to <placeName ref="place:East_019">Newton</placeName> about it
           (but the season bad and <rs ref="ppl:mn1" type="person">her husband</rs> sick did prevent) and that

         <p>
          She believed that want of preferment was the only stop and for her
           part she had no prejudice against him, having his pious
          works with her, but wishes some other way be found to compass

           after they were engaged by her means to each other in point of

I began upon your advice and knowledge? I tell you I will never

           who has been so kind to me and procuring this living of <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName>.
           You shall excuse me for I never will betray them, and my love

           her', or to this purpose he spoke to her.</p>
         <p>
           Upon this answer, <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> turned his utter enemy forever after because she could not work her own ends of him.
           And this is most certainly true: that if she had believed him to
           be guilty of those horrid slanders which she cast on him and me,
          which she had long before that heard and examined,
      </p>
         
         <p>
         
               she would never have admired him so much and
           endeavoured to match him to the best friend she had (as she ever
           called <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName>).

           But, from that time forward, she studied how

          poor man</persName> by stories that she had either invented or others.</p>
         <p>
           And so began to abuse him, as if she was confident I was
           innocent of all those calumnies cast on me, and her conscience did
           own it that I was wronged, but then did asperse him from some
           others of things that was not right done. And so, by this deceit
          wrought on my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> and <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> to have broke
          that match, secretly intending to bring the other of <persName ref="ppl:mb2">Mrs Batt</persName> to
           pass, which not being known to my friends she wrought on them.

         For, before this fire of her malice broke out in public against
           us, she, with her secret insinuations had spoke to myself of
          some stories that had been raised against <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> and pretended
           was told her at <placeName ref="place:Beda_002">Bedale</placeName>, and out of her tender love to <persName ref="ppl:atc1">her cousin,
             Alice</persName>, and myself — which she knew I hated all things of evil, or
          tendencies or appearances of evil in all, much more in any which
        
        I should match <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> to — </p>
         <p>
               she thought fit to acquaint me with what she said she
           had heard. Upon which, I was so extremely afflicted and grieved,
           though only for such things as others would not account ill, that
           I did burst out into many tears and told her, if I did believe
           that he had been guilty of any incivilities, et cetera, I would first
          bury <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> before I would yield to mary her to him
          or any that I knew of so inclined.</p>
         <p>
           She was mightily concerned to see me in such a passion at it,
          and prayed I would not condemn him before I knew more and begged
           I would not cast him off for such a report. And, if I pleased, she
           would first go to him (being in his chamber at
               
           study) and she
           would charge him with such a thing as she had heard; and she
          would tell him that I had sent her on purpose to let him know
           that I had been told; and that he should either clear himself,
           or else I would never consent he should have <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>.
      </p>
         <p>

           Upon which, I was more pacified and bid her go to him
           with that message from me for I loved virtue in all its branches.
           So, she did go to him with this message and did relate all as
           she said to me and my answer. On which acquainting him, as
           above, what that forgery against him, he was in so great a concern and grief that he was in a violency of trouble and like to have
           fallen down with sorrow, and with all the bitterness of weeping and
           trouble protested his innocency of any evil or of that which
           he was charged. And told her, he should hate himself if ever
           she should be any way guilty of any incivility of that kind
           and begged of me, if it could be proved against him, not to own
           him ever again, with many protestations to her of his great wrong.
      </p>
         <p>
              Insomuch she was so fully satisfied of it that she came to
           me again and did become his compurgator,
             and said she
          was confident it was a great lie made by some that had a malice
           against him. And she would inquire more into it and bring me word,
           but begged I would never harbour any ill opinion of him; for
           she never saw any man in such a terror and grief, with tears and other
          great expressions
               
           of his wrong, and was confident he was abased in it
           and begged me not to have any ill opinion, for he was innocent.</p>

        <pb xml:id="page-202"/>






            
          

         <p>But, on the next opportunity, I spoke to him myself, I was so very
          much affected at what she had told me that I could not be satisfied
           without discoursing him my thoughts. But he did, with many great
           and solemn protestations, vindicate himself and showed some
           urgent reason why <persName ref="ppl:mb2">that party</persName> had abused him, because she expected
           to be cast out of that living, which she hoped to have upon marrying
           one of <rs ref="ppl:ps1" type="person">that gentleman's</rs> chaplains. And she, fearing he would lose it 
          because <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> had proffered it to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, she knew
           no way to secure it to <rs type="person">that man</rs> she intended to marry than by
           this indirect way of scandal to make the <rs ref="ppl:ps1" type="person">doctor</rs> to throw him off.
      </p>
         <p>
           After this, he told me that this was made use of to his
           utter ruin here, and that if I believed it should do him much
           wrong; for he knew all was done to prevent it but he, being in
           so great affliction upon this, with his clearing himself in his
          general good behaviour at all times and upon <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby's</persName> enquiring of the said matter more fully, found this was a matter
          of private revenge in <rs ref="ppl:mb2" type="person">that woman</rs>, and she did deny what they
           said in all the circumstances of it. And again, did fully convince me of it  and perfectly cleared and pitied him, so abused.
      </p>

         <p>
              And this was the very business which <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> made
           use of again to have broken this match.<anchor xml:id="ev209-end" type="event"/> And which she was so
           much convinced of was a lie made of him, yet did she go
           now on to revive against him and me for marrying <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> to him.
      </p>
         
         <p>
              These was very ill practices thus used to gain her own
           ends against the vote of her own conscience. I pray God she
           might have repented of all these wicked slanders against a
           minister of God's word and my lawful, honest proceedings.</p>

           by <rs ref="ppl:rs2" type="person">the bishop</rs>, and to take her from me to prevent her marriage

           Having received <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne's</persName> letters, as formerly mentioned,
           concerning the wicked endeavours of <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName> to frustrate this
           match with all my friends as much as in her laid, yet it pleased
           God to bring it to pass for good and not for evil to us, who did
           see my afflictions and pitied my condition, advised by my best
           friends to conclude it and in the name of God to perform that which
             had been so long intended.</p>

           by a lawful minister, minister <persName ref="ppl:cm2">Charles Man</persName> of <placeName ref="place:Gill_105">Gilling</placeName>,

          vindication of my actions.</p>

            And therefore, <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName> was pleased to write to
          my <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName> for her information of the necessity of my
          acting thus from the great debts and other burdens on <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr
        Thornton's</persName> estate, and that I had little or nothing to pay with
        nor had I anything to maintain or educate <persName ref="ppl:rt2">my only
          son, Robert Thornton</persName>, but out of my own small estate
            which was loaded with high taxes and public charges. Therefore, he
            did see fit in vindication of me to say to <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs>, further,</p>

          <p>
         he must further say in justification of my actions that I was
            compelled — out of a prudent care of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs> and necessity — to 
            dispose of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, to a good and a wise and careful person
            as <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName> was, and he knew him so to be. And therefore, he hoped
          none of my friends would condemn me for acting for the
            good and comfort of <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">my children</rs> and family, 
         </p>
      <p>
         and he, being a man of learning and piety and parts, did
        not doubt but by God's blessing he would come to preferment.
        This letter (dated <date when-custom="1668-01-02" datingMethod="#JulianMar">January 2, 1668</date>) and sent to my <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName>
          by the hand of faithful <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>, when she went home after
        the marriage of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> as before said.</p>
        
        <p>
              Which letter did give great satisfaction to <rs ref="ppl:mn1" type="person">my uncle</rs> and
          <persName ref="ppl:awn1">aunt Norton</persName>; being written by so wise and good a man as <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my
            brother Denton</persName>, which knew all the intrigues of this family
          and of whom I had advised with from the first motion of the match,

            
          who did approve of it in the said manner as to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber's</persName> abilities,
          only he had not at present an estate. But said to me, as he did
          to <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my aunt</rs>, no doubt but he would gain preferment and
          here was <placeName ref="place:Ston_053">Stonegrave</placeName> living might be obtained for him.

                to set out more at large my true and sad condition by <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName>,
               his death, my own great sickness and weakness by the heavy
               burdens of my estate (being left in £1500  debt, having nothing
               to maintain or educate <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">my only son</rs> but £100<am>l</am>  for all a year).</p>

         <p>
            And lastly, my own saddest condition by the viperous tongues
           and malice of <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Danby</persName>, and my wicked servants upheld by her,
           to defame my virtue and constant chastity ever kept entire by God's
          gracious goodness to me, which she knew a year and kept it on purpose
           to ruin me and not the grace to let me know how I was wronged,
           so that my <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> was incensed by her (and <persName ref="ppl:ps1">Dr Samways</persName> now)
           to take <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my child</rs> from me. And therefore, I was advised to do this,
           being for my support and relief to choose this way, since <persName ref="ppl:jd2">Mr Denton</persName>
           did concur in it, knowing the state of my sad affairs.
      </p>
         <p>
           Which I hope she would please to join with <persName ref="ppl:jd2">my brother Denton</persName>
           to let my friends know his letter, which I hoped in God would
           vindicate my actions to all the world and — especially to my 
           Christian friends — to have some pity of my sad condition, and
           to believe the truth and pray for me, and to satisfy objections raised

           suitable match for this <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear and eldest child</rs>, even before


        <pb xml:id="page-205"/>






            I entered upon the thought of it (being brought into
          so great extremity of necessity by the sad concerns of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my
          dear husband's</rs> temporal affairs by unjust debts and other troubles
           which induced us to dispose of her sooner than we intended).</p>
         <p>
           But, since by thy gracious providence, thou, in thy wisdom thus
          to order things of this life to be so uneasy by afflictions,
          grant that it may be for the good of our souls and spiritual
           advantage. That we, choosing for our better part in this match, which is not
          for the riches of this world, but a desire to gain eternal riches
           with thee in thy kingdom in the first place and to obtain of thee,
           O Lord, the way to obtain eternal life, not only for ourselves
           but for <rs type="group">our dear children</rs> and family, and place of our abode which thou
          hast cast my lot into.
      </p>
         <p>
           And that, as I have undergone many dreadful trials and
          temptations, both as to the exercises of thy graces of faith and
          patience, thou hast upheld my soul from sinking under them
        or being overcome by the malice of hell or despair of thy
           mercy, but upheld me and delivered me from what was evil and
           brought this marriage to a happy conclusion, in despite of all
           my enemies which hell raised up against me to destroy me for it.</p>
         <p>

           So, O Lord, most holy and gracious, still do to me and
            mine for
          thy own glory, and of your

        mercy show pity, and compassion on
           me,  thy poor, humble handmaid, servant and widow. And
           upon these, thy servants, who are now entered into thy holy
          ordinance of marriage and vouchsafe to give them a great
          share of thy Holy Spirit, with all gifts and graces for this estate
          to which they are now entered.</p>

           O thou, gracious Jesus —
           do thou come and show thy
           miracles of mercy upon these two servants; for whom thou hast done
           so wonderfully to bring and unite them in marriage, who was so far
          distant by that place of their birth and under such great trials before
          they was united.</p>
         <p>
           Do thou, O Lord, have mercy upon them; pardon and forgive
          all our sins which makes us unworthy of the least of thy mercies
          and by the power of thy majesty turn all our afflictions into a
           happy change. Oh, turn our bitter waters of sorrows into the sweet
          and comfortable wine of thy most Holy Spirit; heal our infirmities
           and love us freely. Let them be married to thee in faith and love
          and to each other in all conjugal affection.

         kind to her, as she had deserved from me in performing the

         gave her a Bible for <rs ref="ppl:gl1" type="person">her husband</rs> and a pound of tobacco,
          and withal gave for herself a young cow of three years old and
         a calf, which was most kindly and gratefully acknowledged by

           uncle <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Maulger Norton</persName> of the marriage of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter, Alice</persName>, and
           of all the concerns of that affair, so they were all very well
          pleased with it and prayed God to bless them and wished them
           good luck of their marriage. But <persName ref="ppl:mn1">Mr Norton</persName> asked, why
           did they not lie together; on which, <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> said that it was
          by general consent agreed on that it was more convenient
          to defer that until the publication of the marriage when
           we should invite friends to it. And it may please God I might
           be stronger and be better in my health, having had such a 
          great deal of sorrow on <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> death and for the sad
          slanders falsely raised on me.
      </p>
         <p>
           After which discourse, both of them said it was very well
           and prudently done and prayed God to bless and strengthen me.
         
           Thus, I see the mercies and goodness of the Lord, my God, to me
          who both can and hath overruled the perverse wills of men and
          in much pity had compassion upon my soul and his suffering
           handmaid. In him will I still put my trust for deliverance, who
          has in a great measure heard and answered my humble petitions
           and begun to turn the hearts of my friends towards me.</p>

              I bless God, I also received a most kind and comfortable

           <date when-custom="1669-01-02" datingMethod="#JulianSlash">January 2, 1668/9</date>,
             when I acquainted her with <persName ref="ppl:atc1">Alice's</persName> marriage and the reasons.


        <pb xml:id="page-208"/>






            
           

           <date when-custom="1669-01-08" datingMethod="#JulianSlash">January 8th, 1668/9</date>.
           
           
           
           To which she returned that she was fully convinced and satisfied of the good ends and necessity of my occasion
          and reasons which was a great grief that I should be in such
          circumstances. But she did write a most pious and Christian
           letter, advising me for God's sake not to be so much afflicted
          in spirit nor sorrow too much for those abominable lies and
           slanders, which I never deserved but had a clear conscience from
           all the world ever since she knew me, and that was since I was born.</p>
         <p>
              And that God would deliver me out of them and would reward all my enemies for their wickedness according to their
          deserts. She wished me to satisfy my heart that God would do
           me good for what I endured,

               

            as he did to his servant, Job.
         </p>
         <p>
              She also prayed for me and wished me great comforts
          in this match for what sorrows I endured for <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband</rs> and
           <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1 ppl:rt2" type="group">children</rs>, and for God's cause as for the planting the gospel and
           support my family and children. And did fully believe that God,
           in his good time, will be my comfort and bring me out of all
          like gold tried in the fire seven times in the fire of affliction.
           And will also, in his own good time, when he had tried
          my faith and patience to depend upon him who had sent this
          sad affliction of being ill spoken of for good.
      </p>
         <p>
           He, being a just and upright judge of all the world, will
           <quote xml:id="q-520" type="phrase" source="#_Lamentations_3:59">judge my cause</quote> against all my cursed enemies and will
          make my <quote xml:id="q-521" type="phrase" source="#_Proverbs_22:1 #_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote> which he had given me and was endeavoured
          to be taken away by the devil and his agents. But they shall
           never be able to do me wrong, but God will bring me out
           of all, as he did to Job, and make my <quote xml:id="q-522" type="phrase" source="#_Ecclesiastes_7:1">good name</quote> <quote xml:id="q-523" type="allusion" source="#_Job_11:17">shine

           nor ever failed me. Thus, <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">that good, dear aunt</rs> did
           strive to give me comfort for which I give the Lord, my God,
           all humble and hearty honour
           and glory and praise forever. Amen.
         </p>
         <p>
    
         
              After I received this most comfortable letter from <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my
          dear and only aunt</rs>, I received another letter from good
          <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> of her acquainting my other friends with the marriage
          of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dear child</rs> and of her procuring money for me to
           pay <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> debts. And to let me know she had showed all
          my papers concerning the occasion and transaction of that
          affair from time to time for several years.
      </p>
         <p>
           But yet <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">that false woman</rs> did still persist in her ill
          calumnies and abuses of me, which the Lord forgive her for what
           wickedness she has done and endeavoured against me or <rs ref="ppl:tc1" type="person">this man.</rs>
           She, saying that <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> begs of me that I will not be grieved


        <pb xml:id="page-209"/>






            
         

        for her wicked malice towards me, for God will plead my
          cause for me and will not suffer me to die unrevenged of my
           horrid wrongs by those who had been preserved by charity.
          And that I must not be too much grieved at what the devil
           or man can say against me; for I may take comfort in myself, for none believes any ill of me, she blesses God. (<date when-custom="1669-01-10" datingMethod="#JulianSlash">January  10, 1668/9</date>.)
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
           And for which comfort I have by the good hand and gracious
           providence of my God, and for these good friends of mine,
           especially for <rs ref="ppl:awn1" type="person">my dear aunt</rs> and <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName>, and <persName ref="ppl:en2">cousin Nicholson</persName>, I humbly bless and praise the holy name of God, and pray that
        
           their souls may enjoy everlasting glory forever with him
           in heaven for a reward of their charity to me, a poor creature.
           Lord, grant my prayers and hear my request <quote xml:id="q-524" type="partial" source="#_Romans_15:30">for Jesus Christ's

           her own base, abusive tongue in railing against her. Yet, out

           but she still hated me and us for the reason aforesaid, which proceeded

           desire to pray and preach in the <placeName ref="place:East_019">house</placeName> and teach his children and catechise

           Also, she knew that we both had a good opinion of his

           Upon which letter, he waived this other business, and came down

           upon <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:ktp1" type="group">my daughters</rs> (having but two, and <rs ref="ppl:rt2" type="person">one son</rs>).</p>
         <p>
           In the prosecution of this matter — I, having not one friend
           or relation of my own to repair to for counsel and advice —
          I was forced with <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my daughter Alice</persName> to make use of <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>
           to go to counsel and writings drawn, and so to read and consider

           There is always some busy folk — that was evil themselves — 
          judged ill of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs> and myself for applying of our honest
           and troublesome occasions to be followed by him, God knows,
           which we were forced to make use of in this great concern of our estate,

           It seems some evil, malicious tongues had raised some

          told to <persName ref="ppl:acd1">Mrs Danby</persName>, who knew our business and what dire necessity I was

          of me and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my daughter</rs>, but kept it in her breast from me but told
          others of their lies and so fostered them up so long until they had ruined
           my life and innocent, honest dealings. And then, in a most outrageous
           manner, flew at me with <rs ref="ppl:bt1" type="person">her lying servant</rs> with their slanders, which

      </p>
         <p>
              And was in such a rage that he called her <rs type="person" ref="ppl:acd1">a most impudent and

           wrongs and abused such a virtuous woman as I was and had done for her.
           But I begged he would not turn her out of <rs ref="place:East_019" type="place">the house</rs> then, having no

           and so sent her in a coach to <placeName ref="place:York_060">York</placeName>, for he was not able to see me into
           that condition which I was brought by their abominable wickedness.
           And after he had sent her away, she was so mad at it that she
          had raised and fomented such horrid lies that had so abused me
           and us all about this marriage, which had come to <rs ref="ppl:xw5" type="person">my Lady's</rs> ears.<anchor xml:id="ev218a-end" type="event"/></p>

          that he
           (<persName ref="ppl:xt8">Mr Tancred</persName>)
           
           would lay a guinea that, if <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton</persName> were dead,
          I would be married within a month to this <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, which <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear

           would go to <placeName ref="place:Malt_035">Malton</placeName> <date>that day</date> (being at the fair) on purpose to meet
          with that old rogue (<persName ref="ppl:xt8">Mr Tancred</persName>) to be revenged of him for

      <anchor xml:id="ev219-end" type="event"/></p>
         
         <p>
           Thus, I bless God, he did give me the comfort of <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my dear
             husband's</rs> most dear and faithful affection. As I hope in him,
          he had ever given me grace to persevere
               
             true faithful and all
          loyalty towards him both in life and death. And he knew it
          so to be that would have vindicated me with his blood: for he did
           know that consent of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">his child's</rs> marriage consented to by him.

         <p>
           
           Thus, when <rs ref="ppl:xw5" type="person">my dear and noble Lady</rs> had heard all <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne's</persName>
           history of my wrongs, and how it was begun and proceeded from
           bitter malice, and read my 'Book of My Life until My Widowhood',
           she could not hold from abundance of tears exceedingly,
           and cried out <rs ref="ppl:acd1" type="person">that woman</rs> deserved not to live, who had
           been such a traitor and Judas to me, to take away my honest,

         <p>
               and so wickedly not to declare how I was wronged or
          to stop their mouths by relating her knowledge of the intentions
          of marriage and of that of the estate. And she hoped God would in
          great mercy deliver me in his good time, and she was very
           glad that she had read 'My Book' and my papers that made out all the
        rehearsal of the marriage as before. And was much grieved
           when <persName ref="ppl:dcl1">Daphne</persName> said she had left me in such a sad, disconsolate
           condition, and she did vindicate me from a child and of my

           were her own as long as she lived, and thanked God that she had

          difficulties and sorrows and sufferings which I could not have ever

           <date when-custom="1669-05-17">May the 17, 1669</date>, being a just half year after the marriage
           of <persName ref="ppl:atc1">my dear child and eldest daughter, Alice Thornton</persName>, did I
          invite all our nearest relations and <persName ref="ppl:wt1">Mr Thornton's</persName> friends, which
        
           we could get, to as handsome an entertainment as I could be able
           to procure, considering my own still weakness and ill habit of health:</p>
         <p>
               <persName ref="ppl:jd2">brother Denton</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:etd1" type="person">my sister</rs>; <persName ref="ppl:tp1">my brother Portington</persName> and <rs ref="ppl:ftp1" type="person">my
                sister;</rs> <persName ref="ppl:cm2">Mr Charles Man</persName>, the fortunate person who married them, and
          many other good friends and neighbours.
      </p>
         <p>
              All who expressed their great satisfaction at the solemnity and
          making the publication of this marriage and wished <rs ref="ppl:atc1 ppl:tc1" type="group">the young couple</rs>
           many hearty joys in their marriage, saying they hoped it would,
           by God's blessing, be a great happiness and comfort to us all. At night
          they had also a good supper, and those usual solemnities of a
          marriage of getting <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">the bride</rs> to bed, with a great deal of decency
           and modesty of all parties, was thus this solemnity performed.
           I bless God, he, letting me live to see this great concern of my
          life performed, with such friends' satisfaction which wished myself
           and <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">poor child</rs> well and that by God's blessing may be prospered in his
           fear. We, having solemn prayers twice that day to beg a particular
          blessing upon by children and family.

           And I humbly poured out my prayers, petitions and humble supplications
           to the great <quote xml:id="q-543" type="paraphrase" source="#_Psalms_136:26">God of heaven to have mercy on them</quote>, and to give them
          the choicest of his graces and divine spirit to be over them in all spiritual
            
           blessings and temporal, and give them such a blessing of children as may be

         a blessing to us and make them heirs of eternal life to fulfil his
           kingdom, and to be a comfort to this poor, despised family and me, a
          <quote xml:id="q-544" type="allusion" source="#KJV_1Timothy_5:5">desolate widow</quote>, and to establish the church in this place and
           family to all generations. All which I humbly beg, and whatever else
           it seems good in the eyes of my gracious God, <quote xml:id="q-545" type="partial" source="#_Romans_15:30">for Jesus Christ, his
             sake</quote>, getting all humble thanks and praise, and <quote source="#BCP,_Visitation_of_the_Sick" xml:id="q-546" type="phrase">glory and honour</quote>
          to the great God of mercy which has brought this to pass and has
          not suffered me to perish but preserved us to this great end.
           And will, I hope, confound our malicious enemies, or bring them
           to conversion for our Lord Jesus Christ, his sake. Amen. Amen. Amen.

           In regard I was so odiously blasphemed in my honour
            
        and reputation (which I no ways deserved, I bless God) but for the good
          ends my dear friends has declared the reasons of this match
          in my vindication from hell and his accomplices. I am also in duty
           obliged (both towards God, my guide, and all my own vindication)
           to give all my absent friends, who might unhappily have heard
          the clamours of my enemies, but what was the truth of my condition (or what great reasons and inducements

               
             I was under to
           finish this match so soon, or indeed accept of the first motion)
          they had not received an account of until now.</p>
         <p>
           Therefore, that I might use all lawful and commendable means
           to do myself and the truth right in this concern of so great merit,
           as the marriage of <rs ref="ppl:atc1" type="person">my dearest child</rs>, which I hope providentially
          is disposed to <persName ref="ppl:tc1">Mr Comber</persName>, and will in time so appear to the whole
          world. I have writ to my absent friends of it after the full
           consummation of the marriage and publication thereof. (<date when-custom="1669-05-17">May 17, 1669</date>.)

           I writ to my good friend, <persName ref="ppl:rg1">Mr Ranald Graham</persName>, at <placeName ref="place:Lond_080">London</placeName>,
          to give him a full account of proceedings and what conditions I
           was left in to by debts, who was truly sensible of my sufferings
           as appeared in his letter to <persName ref="ppl:ww1">my uncle William</persName>, when he writ to him
           to get <rs ref="ppl:wt1" type="person">my husband's</rs> bond from him. My letter dated, <date when-custom="1669-06-20">June 20, 1669</date>.</p>

           Two letters of mine, the copies of them also extant, to my
           <persName ref="ppl:mny1">Lady Yorke</persName> after publication to that same effect; she, being so
          much concerned to break the match upon false lies and suggestion
           of my bitter and malicious enemies, was, upon more serious thoughts
           and true information, much afflicted for my wrongs and highly
          satisfied with all our honest proceedings.

              My letter also to <persName ref="ppl:xf2">my good niece Fairfax</persName> found great
           acceptance with her, nor had she ever a misdeeming thought of me
           or any concerned but wished us all imaginable joy and comfort.

          give us this holy food of his precious body to heal all our wounds
           and give us the assurance of eternal life with him. O Lord, grant us
           grace to walk answerably to thy means of salvation, and accept
          of our true repentance and vows of all new obedience for thy bitter
          passion sake. Amen. Amen.
