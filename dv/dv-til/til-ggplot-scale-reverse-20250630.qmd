## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  does the same thing as mutate fct_rev before ggplot, but with a numerical col 
-  (could you also use it with a chr column? no, has to be num.) 




## Example

```{r}
cheshire_petitions |> 
  count(topic) |> 
  ggplot(aes(n, topic)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_x_reverse() # yes very ridiculous 
  #scale_y_reverse() # chr data: nope. 

```



```{r}
#| include: false
# atb/atb_writing/biblical/bibl_stats_explore_20250403.Rmd:1047:  

```
