## Includes

```{r}
source(here::here('R/shared.R'))
```

## Notes

-  use in the same way as ggsave, immediately after the ggplot 
-  this was to make hi quality images for an article 
-  then added a download link in the text pointing to the saved file, for the article authors 
-  updated: no longer needs type 
 


## Function

```{r} 
ggsave_tif <- function(f, w=10, h=7){ 
  ggsave( 
    f,

    device = "tiff", 
    width = w, 
    height = h,
