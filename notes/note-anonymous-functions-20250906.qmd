## Notes

I have been very very rubbish at understanding these. making this as a wip to help me get better

a helpful brief intro in Rodrigues book in [chapter 3](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/fput/fprog.html#basic-anonymous-functions)

- an anonymous function can always be a regular named function - but "sometimes it is faster to simply use an anonymous function as long as it does not hurt clarity".

*cool but useless* post on usefulness and constraints (and suggested alternatives, might follow up later)

> An Anonymous Function (also known as a lambda expression) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier. That is, it is a function that is created and used, but never assigned to a variable.

Hadley Wickham in *adv-r*

> [In R, functions] aren’t automatically bound to a name... R doesn’t have a special syntax for creating a named function: when you create a function, you use the regular assignment operator to give it a name. If you choose not to give the function a name, you get an anonymous function.
>You use an anonymous function when it’s not worth the effort to give it a name:


Likely to be most useful for v small functions that you won't need to reuse (but if you do it's easy to turn the anonymous function into a named one)


## Examples

a list of slightly varying datasets - want to map over them to make simple histograms

RHC heights 

```{r}
# (need height filter because of an erroneous value lol)
rhc_heights <-
rhc |>
  filter(between(height_inches, 50, 90) & gender %in% c("female", "male"))
```

a simple histogram with base hist()

```{r}
hist(rhc_heights$height_inches)
```


```{r}
# use group_split to make list of DFs
rhc_gender_heights <-
rhc |>
  filter(between(height_inches, 50, 80) & gender %in% c("female", "male")) |>
  group_split(gender)
```


If you try something like `map(rhc_gender_heights, ~hist(height_inches))` it won't work.

One solution is to use an anonymous function.

```{r}
map(rhc_gender_heights, (function(x) hist(x$height_inches)))
```
