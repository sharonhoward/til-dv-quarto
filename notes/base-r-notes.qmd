## Notes

WIP on getting to know base R better. 

See also TILs tagged `base`, but this is for more general notes and resources.


### getting help

- within R/Rstudio to open up the docs

```{r}
#help(package = 'base')
```

that won't include the other default packages that are loaded with base:

- datasets
- utils
- grDevices
- graphics
- stats" 


- docs on the web: official, full, up-to-date list of packages on CRAN, linking to all the reference manuals:

https://search.r-project.org/R/doc/html/packages.html

refman for base:

and for stats:
